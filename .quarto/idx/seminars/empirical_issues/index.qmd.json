Quadratic? Log-log? Semi-log?\n\n- Misspecification of x’s is similar to OVB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 4) Signaling {.smaller}\n\n\n_The fourth source of bias is: Signaling_\n\n- Perhaps, some individuals are signaling the existence of an X without truly having it:\n\n    - For instance: firms signaling they have good governance without having it\n\n- This is similar to the OVB because you cannot observe the full story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 5) Simultaneity {.smaller}\n\n\n\n_The fifth source of bias is: Simultaneity_\n\n- Perhaps gov and some other variable x are determined simultaneously\n\n- Perhaps there is bidirectional causation, with q causing gov and gov also causing q \n\n- In both cases, OLS regression will provide a biased estimate of the effect\n\n- Also, the sign might be wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 6) Heterogeneous effects {.smaller}\n\n\n_The sixth source of bias is: Heterogeneous effects_\n\n- Maybe the causal effect of gov on q depends on observed and unobserved firm characteristics:\n\n    - Let's assume that firms seek to maximize q\n    - Different firms have different optimal gov\n    - Firms know their optimal gov\n    - If we observed all factors that affect q, each firm would be at its own optimum and OLS regression would give a non-significant coefficient\n\n\n- In such case, we may find a positive or negative relationship.\n\n- Neither is the true causal relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n## 7) Construct validity {.smaller}\n\n\n_The seventh source of bias is: Construct validity_\n\n- Some constructs (e.g. Corporate governance) are complex, and sometimes have conflicting mechanisms\n\n- We usually don’t know for sure what “good” governance is, for instance\n\n- It is common that we use imperfect proxies\n\n- They may poorly fit the underlying concept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 8) Measurement error {.smaller}\n\n\n\n_The eighth source of bias is: Measurement error_\n\n\n- \"Classical\" random measurement error for the outcome will inflate standard errors but will not lead to biased coefficients. \n\n    -

High gov (let's say they are the treated group)\n    - Low gov (let's say they are the control group)\n    \n    \n- Without any matching method, these companies are likely not comparable\n\n- Thus, the estimated beta will contain selection bias\n\n- The bias can be either be positive or negative\n\n- It is similar to OVB\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n##  12) Self-Selection {.smaller}\n\n\n_The twelfth source of bias is: Self-Selection_\n\n\n- Self-selection is a type of selection bias\n\n- Usually, firms decide which level of governance they adopt\n\n- There are reasons why firms adopt high governance\n\n    -
