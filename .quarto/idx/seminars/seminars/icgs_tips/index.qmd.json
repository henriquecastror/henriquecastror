Learning to receive negative feedback to work on your weakness is super important to succeed in your career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 2: Never omit references {.smaller}\n\n\nEditors know the literature so well. If you are omitting essential references, they will notice it.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n## Tip 3: You need a story {.smaller}\n\nIt doesn't matter if you have the perfect empirical design or the nicest dataset; if you do not have a story to tell, you are in trouble.\n\n**Learn to create and to tell your story.**\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 4: Introduction is the main part {.smaller}\n\nThe introduction is where reviewers decide whether they like or not your article.\n\nThe introduction is about 10% of the paper's length, but you should work **25% of your time** on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 5: Abstract needs to be crystal-clear {.smaller}\n\nThe abstract is always the only part that reviewers and editors always thoroughly read.\n\nSo, it needs to be as clear as possible.\n\nAnd it needs to **deliver the message right away**.\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 6: Focus on the contribution {.smaller}\n\nThe most critical factor in getting published is to **have a contribution**.\n\nThe definition of contribution is subjective, but editors and reviewers can always smell if you don't have one.\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 7: Understand the journal {.smaller}\n\nYou have to **understand the journal**, the scope, and the past articles in there.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the journal's characteristics, you have less chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 8: Don't do papers, Do projects {.smaller}\n\nIf you have an **established and well-thought project where you get excited** every day, your chances of success are high.\n\nIf you only do papers for the sake of doing it, you'll get frustrated eventually. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 9: Explore the context {.smaller}\n\nYou always have to explore the context of your sample and/or dataset.\n\nProviding new results of an established topic is ok...\n\n...but **exploring your context to provide new insights** is better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 10: 90% persistence, 10% I.Q. {.smaller}\n\nPublishing is about **90% persistence**. \n\nThe remaining 10% is about being smart.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 11: Letters matter {.smaller}\n\nAuthors sometimes do not pay attention to the cover letter or to response letters to reviewers. \n\nBut letters matter. And they matter a lot.\n\n**Learn how to write good letters**. And be honest in them. Don't try to oversell your article; editors smell such things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 12: Editors want to publish {.smaller}\n\nFinally, remember that no editor is blocking you. \n\nThey want to publish articles. But they want to publish **good** articles. \n\nYou have to do your job of getting and submitting a good one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## THANK YOU!\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](fgv.png){fig-align=\"right\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n**Henrique Castro Martins**\n\n-   [henrique.martins\\@fgv.br](henrique.martins@fgv.br)\n-   <https://eaesp.fgv.br/en/people/henrique-castro-martins>\n-   [henriquemartins.net](https://henriquemartins.net/)\n-   <https://www.linkedin.com/in/henriquecastror/>\n:::\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\n## ICGS Editors' Tips {.smaller}\n\n\n\nI will share in these slides the notes I took from the two panels with editors from A-Journals at the [**International Corporate Governance Society (ICGS)**](https://icgsociety.org/) Annual Meeting.\n\nI hope you like it!\n\n\n\n## Tip 1: Learn to receive feedback {.smaller}\n\n**This is the most important tip.** \n\nWhen we get a rejection, we usually get frustrated.
