Learning to receive negative feedback to work on your weakness is super important to succeed in your career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 2: Never omit references {.smaller}\n\n\nEditors know the literature so well. If you are omitting essential references, they will notice it.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n## Tip 3: You need a story {.smaller}\n\nIt doesn't matter if you have the perfect empirical design or the nicest dataset; if you do not have a story to tell, you are in trouble.\n\n**Learn to create and to tell your story.**\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 4: Introduction is the main part {.smaller}\n\nThe introduction is where reviewers decide whether they like or not your article.\n\nThe introduction is about 10% of the paper's length, but you should work **25% of your time** on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 5: Abstract needs to be crystal-clear {.smaller}\n\nThe abstract is always the only part that reviewers and editors always thoroughly read.\n\nSo, it needs to be as clear as possible.\n\nAnd it needs to **deliver the message right away**.\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 6: Focus on the contribution {.smaller}\n\nThe most critical factor in getting published is to **have a contribution**.\n\nThe definition of contribution is subjective, but editors and reviewers can always smell if you don't have one.\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 7: Understand the journal {.smaller}\n\nYou have to **understand the journal**, the scope, and the past articles in there.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the journal's characteristics, you have less chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 8: Don't do papers, Do projects {.smaller}\n\nIf you have an **established and well-thought project where you get excited** every day, your chances of success are high.\n\nIf you only do papers for the sake of doing it, you'll get frustrated eventually. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 9: Explore the context {.smaller}\n\nYou always have to explore the context of your sample and/or dataset.\n\nProviding new results of an established topic is ok...\n\n...but **exploring your context to provide new insights** is better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 10: 90% persistence, 10% I.Q. {.smaller}\n\nPublishing is about **90% persistence**. \n\nThe remaining 10% is about being smart.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 11: Letters matter {.smaller}\n\nAuthors sometimes do not pay attention to the cover letter or to response letters to reviewers. \n\nBut letters matter. And they matter a lot.\n\n**Learn how to write good letters**. And be honest in them. Don't try to oversell your article; editors smell such things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tip 12: Editors want to publish {.smaller}\n\nFinally, remember that no editor is blocking you. \n\nThey want to publish articles. But they want to publish **good** articles. \n\nYou have to do your job of getting and submitting a good one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## THANK YOU!\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](fgv.png){fig-align=\"right\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n**Henrique Castro Martins**\n\n-   [henrique.martins\\@fgv.br](henrique.martins@fgv.br)\n-   <https://eaesp.fgv.br/en/people/henrique-castro-martins>\n-   [henriquemartins.net](https://henriquemartins.net/)\n-   <https://www.linkedin.com/in/henriquecastror/>\n:::\n:::\n"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":false,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","auto-stretch":true,"editor":"visual","comments":{"giscus":{"repo":"henriquecastror/comments","category":"Blog"}},"title-block-banner-color":"body","toc-location":"left","search":true,"title":"My notes about the 2020 ICGS Editors' tips","date":"2020-11-16","author":"Henrique C.
