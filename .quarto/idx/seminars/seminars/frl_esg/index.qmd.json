(2014); Fernández-Kranz and Santaló (2010), Flammer (2015a), and Vural-Yavaç (2020). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## But in Emerging Markets {.smaller}\n\nThe **'Escape from competition argument' is less likely to hold**, because:\n\n- Worse Investor protection, higher agency problems\n\n- Poor institutions, high corruption\n\n- Corporate practices are more opaque\n\n. . .\n\nThus, **stakeholders are less likely to evaluate correctly the returns of strategies based on ESG practices**, even profitable ones. \n\n. . .\n\n*Hypothesis 1: Competition is negatively associated with corporate ESG practices.*\n\n*Hypothesis 2: An increase in competition decreases corporate investment in ESG practices.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shock in Competition: Brazil 2015 {.smaller}\n\n\n- Beginning of a **presidential impeachment**\n\n- **Negative GDP growth** of about 3.5%\n\n- Skyrocketing **inflation** of about 10.5%\n\n- **Decrease in exports and imports** of goods and services of around 14% and 24%, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shock in Competition: Brazil 2015\n\n<img src=\"Imagem1.png\" width=\"85%\" />\n\n\n*Source: World Economic Forum.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Sample {.smaller}\n\n- Sample of **5.971 firm-year observations for 22 emerging economies** (Kearney, 2012)\n\n- Period: **2011-2019**\n\n- Database: **Thomson Reuters Eikon**\n\n    - Financial and ESG data\n\n\n- Two types of models:\n\n    - Either **Firm FE or Country & Industry FE**\n    - **DiD**: Brazil (treatment), 21 emerging markets (control), shock in 2015.\n    - Yearly propensity-score matching over the observables, with and without replacement.\n\n- Ind.

Findings of G are more ambiguous.\n\n. . .\n\n- Results contradict US-based findings: Fernández-Kranz and Santaló (2010), Flammer (2015b), and Leong and Yang (2020).\n\n    - This is the interesting part of this article.\n\n. . .\n\n- Managers from emerging markets **decrease ESG performance** to face **more challenging and uncertain times**, supporting the view that they invest in these practices for **altruistic** purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## THANK YOU!\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](fgv.png){fig-align=\"right\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n**Henrique Castro Martins**\n\n-   [henrique.martins\\@fgv.br](henrique.martins@fgv.br)\n-   <https://eaesp.fgv.br/en/people/henrique-castro-martins>\n-   [henriquemartins.net](https://henriquemartins.net/)\n-   <https://www.linkedin.com/in/henriquecastror/>\n:::\n:::\n"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":false,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","auto-stretch":true,"editor":"visual","comments":{"giscus":{"repo":"henriquecastror/comments","category":"Blog"}},"title-block-banner-color":"body","toc-location":"left","search":true,"title":"Competition and ESG practices in emerging markets","date":"2021-04-05","author":"Henrique C.
