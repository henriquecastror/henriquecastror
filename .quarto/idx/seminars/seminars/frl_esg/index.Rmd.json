(2014); Fernández-Kranz and Santaló (2010), Flammer (2015a), and Vural-Yavaç (2020). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# But in Emerging Markets\n\nThe **'Escape from competition argument' is less likely to hold**, because:\n\n- Worse Investor protection, higher agency problems\n\n- Poor institutions, high corruption\n\n- Corporate practices are more opaque\n\n--\n\nThus, **stakeholders are less likely to evaluate correctly the returns of strategies based on ESG practices**, even profitable ones. \n\n--\n\n*Hypothesis 1: Competition is negatively associated with corporate ESG practices.*\n\n*Hypothesis 2: An increase in competition decreases corporate investment in ESG practices.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Shock in Competition: Brazil 2015\n\n\n- Beginning of a **presidential impeachment**\n\n- **Negative GDP growth** of about 3.5%\n\n- Skyrocketing **inflation** of about 10.5%\n\n- **Decrease in exports and imports** of goods and services of around 14% and 24%, respectively.\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Shock in Competition: Brazil 2015\n\n<img src=\"Imagem1.png\" width=\"85%\" />\n\n\n*Source: World Economic Forum.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Sample\n\n- Sample of **5.971 firm-year observations for 22 emerging economies** (Kearney, 2012)\n\n- Period: **2011-2019**\n\n- Database: **Thomson Reuters Eikon**\n\n    - Financial and ESG data\n\n\n- Two types of models:\n\n    - Either **Firm FE or Country & Industry FE**\n    - **DiD**: Brazil (treatment), 21 emerging markets (control), shock in 2015.\n    - Yearly propensity-score matching over the observables, with and without replacement.\n\n- Ind.
