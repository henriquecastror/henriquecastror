The **culture in the course helps**.\n\n\n\n\n\n## A good case has clear learning objectives  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# A case needs clear learning objectives\n\n- Each pasture has its own learning objective.\n  - The same case can be taught in many different ways to accommodate different learning objectives based on the audience or course.\n- **Managing students expectations very early on is crucial**. One pasture may have more than one learning objective, but we set expectations to only one (i.e., finance).\n  - If students don't prepare, the pastures get mixed, which results in the learning objectives not being fulfilled.\n\n:::\n\n. . . \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n#  A pasture has 1 or more takeaways.\n\n- Takeaway is a definitive statement (not a question) about a lesson that is\n  - Important AND New/surprising.\n  \n- Conflict are the best takeaways.   \n- Takeaways and learning objectives (e.g., the goals of a pasture) are **audience-specific**. \n\n:::\n\n. . . \n\n**My take**: That is why, after you learn the story, we should always start with the learning objectives, only then we write the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## A good case has clear timeline  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n# The sequence of events must be clear to students.\n\n- As all good stories, a good case contains a sequence of events.\n- Again, students are not expected to bring information outside the case.\n- The instructor needs to control the flow of information/discussion. \n  - **This is only possible with a clear timeline of the events.**\n\n___\n\n**There is a natural tradeoff here: details vs. brevity. **\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Teaching plan comes before the writing   {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# How to develop a case?\n\n**1) Idea (or opportunity)**\n\n**2) Learning objectives & Teaching Plan **\n\n**3) Protagonist interview (often only one, but it is possible to have more than one)**\n\n**4) Teaching case & Teaching notes & Teaching itself**\n\n**5) Improve Teaching case and Teaching notes**\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How to cope with the main \"issues\" of teaching with cases? {background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n\n## How to cope with the main \"issues\"? {.smaller background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n**Undergraduate courses:**\n\n::: incremental    \n\n- Cases are shorter.\n- Pastures are more clearly defined and shorter. Students do not have enough background to stay (discuss) too long in a pasture. **Takeaways should be simpler and more generic.**\n- **Teaching plan is the most important part**, it may involve a lecture within:\n  - \"A Sandwich\" \n    - Case/Lecture/Case\n- **Always focus on the decision, not the story**.\n- **An Idea:** one writes a large case in sections, and use only one in a given session.\n  - A case involving all topics of a course is hard but not impossible.\n  - *Maybe, you write the case, then develop the course* \n \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## How to cope with the main \"issues\"? {.smaller background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n- *Students may say, 'I am frustrated because the case has no solution.'*\n\n  - More common in undergrad students. Usually, students demand the \"right\" answer. \n  - But the idea is *there is no right answer in a good dilemma*. \n\n. . . \n\n- *They don't want concepts, they want solved problems*.\n\n  - It might be a generational thing.\n  - The tip is to go back to the fundamentals of making a decision. \n    - *If you were in the protagonist’s shoes, what would you do?*\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n## How to cope with the main \"issues\"? {.smaller background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n\n- *What happens is the \"correct\" answer*.\n  \n  - Almost always they don't discuss what happened.\n  - Students are informed that the decisions/interactions should be extracted from the case.\n    - If a student brings something out of the case, they get penalized.\n    - Students are expected to inform the instructor whether they are expert in the industry or in the firm. They are the last to speak (if they are called to do).\n    - \"Expert knowledge\" is undesired. The focus is on the decision of the case. Not the story.\n    \n. . . \n\n\n- *Audience Heterogeneity* (in grad. courses)\n\n  - Half-full glass solution: this allows \"new\" perspectives in a given pasture.\n  - Again, \"Expertise\" is not welcomed.\n  \n  \n\n\n# How to make this \"story\" a good \"case\"? {background=\"#b1d6fc\"}\n\n\n## {background=\"#b1d6fc\"}\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"1100\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1naeY2NQ8o\"></iframe>\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n## How to make this \"story\" a good \"case\"? {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**The framework:**\n\n- Define the protagonist\n- Define the learning objectives\n- Define the teaching plan & pastures\n- Define the takeaways of each pasture\n\n\n\n\n\n## The framework {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the protagonist**\n\n  - As far as I know, the most likely person to focus on is the CEO who revealed the scandal, but we could also focus on a director or an important investor.\n  - A crucial factor is to have access to that person and for him or her to be willing to talk about the events.\n    - not trivial in this example, I assume.\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the learning objectives**\n\n  - This is most likely a financial/accounting case, but it could be a governance or a supply chain case.\n  \n::: incremental    \n   - **Accounting aspects:** *risco sacado*, accounting aspects of supplier financing vs debt financing, effects in the income statement, etc.\n   - **Finance aspects:** differences of debt vs suppliers in the balance sheet? cost of debt vs. cost of suppliers? What are the consequences in terms of collateral?, etc.  \n   - **(Overlap) Legal aspects**: what was illegal and what was legal? Has the law been bent? Do the creditors have a case to go to the court?\n   - **(Overlap) Governance**: what governance mechanism has failed? Was it a governance issue, in the first place? How could we improve the governance based on this case? \n   - **(Overlap) Supply chain**: what features of the supply chain allowed this problem? Is it an industry thing or it is more common than we imagine? What is the impact of the supply chain in the valuation of a company?\n:::     \n  \n\n\n\n##  {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the teaching plan**\n\n- This is contextual to the course you are teaching, but you must have a clear picture of the pastures you will use.\n- At HBS, sessions take 80 minutes. We are used to longer sessions. \n  - Good for 3 or 4 pastures. More can be too much. \n- This is obviously connected to the learning objectives as you have defined them.  \n\n\n\n\n\n##  {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the teaching plan**    \n\nOne idea of Teaching Plan:\n\n- **Pasture 1:** Was there something illegal?\n\n. . . \n\n- **Pasture 2:** Let's crunch the numbers to see how big the problem is.\n\n. . . \n\n- **Pasture 3:** So, now that we understand the problem, what could we have done to avoid it?\n\n. . . \n\n- **Pasture 4:** Finally, what kind of control mechanism/structure we would need to create to avoid this in the future?\n\n\n. . . \n\nNotice that this Teaching Plan does not invite \"expert\" knowledge. Students would have to know the basics of financial accounting (I am assuming this is a finance accounting course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the takeaways of each pasture**\n\nSome ideas:\n\n::: incremental    \n   - **Accounting aspects:** *supplier financing has a different effect in the income statement, and companies may play with it.* \n   - **Finance aspects:** *Companies do not pay interest on supplier financing the same way they pay to creditors.*  \n   - **(Overlap) Legal aspects**: *Shady decisions can be costly*\n   - **(Overlap) Governance**:  *A board of directors needs an financial expert.*\n   - **(Overlap) Supply chain**: *Supplier financing is industry-specific and may have considerable influence in a firms' bottom line and value.* \n:::     \n  \n\n\n# Now, it is your turn... {.smaller background=\"#191f36\"}\n\n::: footer\n:::\n\n\n## (Previous) Questions {.smaller background=\"#191f36\"}\n\n::: incremental\n\n- *O estudo de casos reais e já decididos tem a mesma importância de casos hipotéticos?*\n- *Como ter ideias para escrever estudos de caso?*\n- *Como ser mais efetiva na aplicação de casos com alunos da graduação, gerando reflexões e conexão com desafios atuais das organizações?*\n- *Como definir amostragem para o recorte acadêmico necessário?*\n- *Considerando que sou professora de penal e processo penal, quero mais ouvir e verificar o que posso utilizar, sobretudo para mesurar os problemas com base em estatísticas judiciais ou outras métricas.*\n- *Como transformar experiências de consultorias em publicação de casos na GV Casos e outras revistas relevantes?*\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Interact  {.smaller background=\"#191f36\" visibility=hidden} \n\n<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"henriquecastror/misc\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOLiNrXQ\"\n        data-mapping=\"number\"\n        data-term=\"1\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"bottom\"\n        data-theme=\"light\"\n        data-lang=\"en\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n\n\n\n::: footer\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Did you like it?  {.smaller background=\"#191f36\"}\n\n<center>\n![](qr.png){width=\"50%\" heigth=\"50%\"}\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n::: footer\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **THANK YOU!** {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n![](qa2.png){width=\"150%\" heigth=\"150%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Henrique C.

Students should read before the class, not usual in Br.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## It needs friction  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n![](example.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## It needs drama  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n# Often, the decision-maker is:\n\n- \"Flying to a board meeting still not knowing what to do.\"\n- \"Driving home thinking about tomorrow's 8 am meeting.\"\n- \"Arriving at a meeting thinking about the new perspective they just thought of.\"\n\n:::\n\n. . . \n\nThe goal here is to have students put themselves in the protagonist's shoes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## It is a good story, but this is not enough  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# While a good case is always a good story, the reverse is not necessarily true.\n\n- As a case writer, it is crucial to differentiate between a good story and a good case.\n- A good case teaches us *something*, which may not always be the case with a good story.\n- The *something* can vary but is always related to the friction.\n  - This is why I previously used the concept of 'like a myth'.\n  - It is both **new** and **important**.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## If the case can be multimedia, so be it  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# If possible, you can explore many forms of media.\n\n- Newspapers (often)\n- Videos, interviews, podcasts, etc.\n- Corporate documents (if available)\n- Etc.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Potential decisions based on Theory  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n# The problem of the protagonist should have alternatives. They must both be potentially based on theory.\n\n- The students may not always be familiar with the theory beforehand. \n- In such situations, it is a good opportunity to briefly discuss the theory. \n  - But ensuring the session doesn't become a lecture on the theory.\n  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Pastures  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n<center>\n![](pastures.jpg)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n## Pastures  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n# The case has 2 to 4 pastures.\n\n- During a session, instructors rarely give the \"answer\" of a pasture...\n\n::: incremental\n\n  - ... but they **conduct quite clearly** the movement between pastures.\n  - You need to plan time, but, more importantly, you need to **plan the transitions**. \n\n- The pastures should be trivial to the instructor in the main text (at least in the teaching notes). \n\n  - It might not be that clear to an expert student. \n  - It almost never clear to a beginner. \n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**My take**: As a instructor (that knows the theory and sometimes how things are done in \"real life\"), it is hard to stay too long in a pasture. **It seems a waste of time**. \n\n- But in a trilling group/session, staying in a pasture almost always teach us something about a new perspective. The **culture in the course helps**.\n\n\n\n\n\n## A good case has clear learning objectives  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# A case needs clear learning objectives\n\n- Each pasture has its own learning objective.\n  - The same case can be taught in many different ways to accommodate different learning objectives based on the audience or course.\n- **Managing students expectations very early on is crucial**. One pasture may have more than one learning objective, but we set expectations to only one (i.e., finance).\n  - If students don't prepare, the pastures get mixed, which results in the learning objectives not being fulfilled.\n\n:::\n\n. . . \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n#  A pasture has 1 or more takeaways.\n\n- Takeaway is a definitive statement (not a question) about a lesson that is\n  - Important AND New/surprising.\n  \n- Conflict are the best takeaways.   \n- Takeaways and learning objectives (e.g., the goals of a pasture) are **audience-specific**. \n\n:::\n\n. . . \n\n**My take**: That is why, after you learn the story, we should always start with the learning objectives, only then we write the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## A good case has clear timeline  {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n# The sequence of events must be clear to students.\n\n- As all good stories, a good case contains a sequence of events.\n- Again, students are not expected to bring information outside the case.\n- The instructor needs to control the flow of information/discussion. \n  - **This is only possible with a clear timeline of the events.**\n\n___\n\n**There is a natural tradeoff here: details vs. brevity. **\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Teaching plan comes before the writing   {.smaller background=\"#d0e0e3\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# How to develop a case?\n\n**1) Idea (or opportunity)**\n\n**2) Learning objectives & Teaching Plan **\n\n**3) Protagonist interview (often only one, but it is possible to have more than one)**\n\n**4) Teaching case & Teaching notes & Teaching itself**\n\n**5) Improve Teaching case and Teaching notes**\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How to cope with the main \"issues\" of teaching with cases? {background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n\n## How to cope with the main \"issues\"? {.smaller background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n**Undergraduate courses:**\n\n::: incremental    \n\n- Cases are shorter.\n- Pastures are more clearly defined and shorter. Students do not have enough background to stay (discuss) too long in a pasture. **Takeaways should be simpler and more generic.**\n- **Teaching plan is the most important part**, it may involve a lecture within:\n  - \"A Sandwich\" \n    - Case/Lecture/Case\n- **Always focus on the decision, not the story**.\n- **An Idea:** one writes a large case in sections, and use only one in a given session.\n  - A case involving all topics of a course is hard but not impossible.\n  - *Maybe, you write the case, then develop the course* \n \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## How to cope with the main \"issues\"? {.smaller background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n- *Students may say, 'I am frustrated because the case has no solution.'*\n\n  - More common in undergrad students. Usually, students demand the \"right\" answer. \n  - But the idea is *there is no right answer in a good dilemma*. \n\n. . . \n\n- *They don't want concepts, they want solved problems*.\n\n  - It might be a generational thing.\n  - The tip is to go back to the fundamentals of making a decision. \n    - *If you were in the protagonist’s shoes, what would you do?*\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n## How to cope with the main \"issues\"? {.smaller background=\"#d9d2e9\"}\n\n\n- *What happens is the \"correct\" answer*.\n  \n  - Almost always they don't discuss what happened.\n  - Students are informed that the decisions/interactions should be extracted from the case.\n    - If a student brings something out of the case, they get penalized.\n    - Students are expected to inform the instructor whether they are expert in the industry or in the firm. They are the last to speak (if they are called to do).\n    - \"Expert knowledge\" is undesired. The focus is on the decision of the case. Not the story.\n    \n. . . \n\n\n- *Audience Heterogeneity* (in grad. courses)\n\n  - Half-full glass solution: this allows \"new\" perspectives in a given pasture.\n  - Again, \"Expertise\" is not welcomed.\n  \n  \n\n\n# How to make this \"story\" a good \"case\"? {background=\"#b1d6fc\"}\n\n\n## {background=\"#b1d6fc\"}\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"1100\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1naeY2NQ8o\"></iframe>\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n## How to make this \"story\" a good \"case\"? {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**The framework:**\n\n- Define the protagonist\n- Define the learning objectives\n- Define the teaching plan & pastures\n- Define the takeaways of each pasture\n\n\n\n\n\n## The framework {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the protagonist**\n\n  - As far as I know, the most likely person to focus on is the CEO who revealed the scandal, but we could also focus on a director or an important investor.\n  - A crucial factor is to have access to that person and for him or her to be willing to talk about the events.\n    - not trivial in this example, I assume.\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the learning objectives**\n\n  - This is most likely a financial/accounting case, but it could be a governance or a supply chain case.\n  \n::: incremental    \n   - **Accounting aspects:** *risco sacado*, accounting aspects of supplier financing vs debt financing, effects in the income statement, etc.\n   - **Finance aspects:** differences of debt vs suppliers in the balance sheet? cost of debt vs. cost of suppliers? What are the consequences in terms of collateral?, etc.  \n   - **(Overlap) Legal aspects**: what was illegal and what was legal? Has the law been bent? Do the creditors have a case to go to the court?\n   - **(Overlap) Governance**: what governance mechanism has failed? Was it a governance issue, in the first place? How could we improve the governance based on this case? \n   - **(Overlap) Supply chain**: what features of the supply chain allowed this problem?

We are used to longer sessions. \n  - Good for 3 or 4 pastures. More can be too much. \n- This is obviously connected to the learning objectives as you have defined them.  \n\n\n\n\n\n##  {background=\"#b1d6fc\" .smaller}\n\n**Define the teaching plan**    \n\nOne idea of Teaching Plan:\n\n- **Pasture 1:** Was there something illegal?\n\n. . . \n\n- **Pasture 2:** Let's crunch the numbers to see how big the problem is.\n\n. . . \n\n- **Pasture 3:** So, now that we understand the problem, what could we have done to avoid it?\n\n. . . \n\n- **Pasture 4:** Finally, what kind of control mechanism/structure we would need to create to avoid this in the future?\n\n\n. . . \n\nNotice that this Teaching Plan does not invite \"expert\" knowledge.
