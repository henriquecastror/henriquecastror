U.S. Treasury securities represents the single largest sector of the U.S. bond market. The same is true un Brazil.\n\n. . .\n\n![](figs/bm_24_3.png)\n\nTreasury-Inflation-Protected Securities are called **TIPS**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n\n<center>\n![](figs/td1.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n<center>\n![](figs/td2.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.2 Other Types of Debt {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\n- On April 15, 1998, the U.S. Treasury issued a 30-year inflation-indexed note with a coupon of 3 5/8%. \n- On the date of issue, the consumer price index (C P I ) was 161.740. \n- On April 15, 2012, the C P I had increased to 229.177. \n- What coupon payment was made on April 18, 2012\n\n**Solution**\n\n- Between the issue date and April 15, 2012, the CPI appreciated by $\\frac{229.177}{161.740}=41.695\\%$. \n- Consequently, the principal amount of the bond increased to $1000 \\times 1.41695 = 1416.95$\n- The semiannual coupon payment was $1416.95 \\times \\frac{0.003625}{2} = 25.68$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.2 Other Types of Debt {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n**Municipal Bonds (Munis)**\n\n- Bonds issued by state and local governments.\n- They are not taxable at the federal level (and sometimes at the state and local level as well).\n- Sometimes referred to as tax-exempt bonds.\n- Not common in Brazil. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.2 Other Types of Debt {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n**Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)**\n\n- Securities made up of other financial securities. Security’s cash flows come from the cash flows of the underlying financial securities that “back” it.\n\n**Asset Securitization**: The process of creating an asset-backed security.\n\n**Mortgage-Backed Security**: Largest ABS market. Backed by home mortgages. Often they are guaranteed against default risk by the U.S. government. \n\n- When homeowners in the underlying mortgages make their mortgage payments, this cash goes (minus servicing fees) to the holders of the mortgage-backed security.\n\n- Private organizations, such as banks, also issue ABS. These securities can be backed by home mortgages or other kinds of consumer loans such as automobile loans and credit card receivables. \n\n- When banks re-securitize asset-backed and other fixed income securities, the new asset-backed security is known as a **collateralized debt obligation (CDO)**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n![](figs/cmo.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n# 24.3 Bond Covenants {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n## 24.3 Bond Covenants {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Restrictive clauses in a bond contract that limit the issuers from undercutting their ability to repay the bonds**.\n\nFor example, covenants may:\n\n - Restrict the ability of management to pay dividends\n - Restrict the level of further indebtedness\n - Specify that the issuer must maintain a minimum amount of working capital\n\n. . .\n\nThere are: positive and negative covenants\n\n- **Positive**: the firm must do something (keep specific financial ratios, pay taxes and other obligations, etc)\n\n- **Negative**: the firm must not do something (sell specific assets, pay too much dividend, etc)\n\n\nCovenants are a common feature of bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n \nA bond issuer typically **repays its bonds by making coupon and principal payments** as specified in the bond contract. **However**, the issuer can:\n\n- Repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the market.\n- Make a tender offer for the entire issue.\n- Exercise a call provision.\n\n. . .\n\n**Callable Bonds**: Bonds that contain a call provision that allows the issuer to repurchase the bonds at a predetermined price.\n\n**Call provisions**: Allows the issuer of the bond the right (not obligation) to retire all outstanding bonds on (or after) a specific date, for the call price. The call price is generally set at or above, and expressed as a \\% of face value (e.g..102\\% of face value).\n\n. . . \n\n- A firm may choose to call a bond issue if interest rates have fallen.\n- The issuer can lower its borrowing costs by exercising the call on the callable bond and then immediately refinancing the issue at a lower rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Callable Bonds**\n\n- Holders of callable bonds understand that the issuer will exercise the call option only when the coupon rate of the bond exceeds the prevailing market rate.\n- If a bond is called, investors must reinvest the proceeds when market rates are lower than the coupon rate they are currently receiving.\n- This makes callable bonds relatively less attractive to bondholders than identical non-callable bonds.\n- A callable bond will trade at a lower price (and therefore a higher yield) than an otherwise equivalent non-callable bond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Sinking Fund**\n\n- A method of repaying a bond in which a company makes regular payments into a fund administered by a trustee over the life of the bond.\n- These payments are then used to repurchase bonds.\n- This allows the firm to retire some of the outstanding debt without affecting the cash flows of the remaining bonds.\n\n- The trust can either repurchase the bonds in the market (if the price is below the face value) or by lottery at the par (if the price is above face value).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Convertible Bond**: A corporate bond with a provision that gives the bondholder an option to convert each bond owned into a fixed number of shares of common stock.\n\n**Conversion Ratio**:  The number of shares received upon conversion of a convertible bond, usually stated per $1000 of face value.\n\n**Conversion Price**: The face value of a convertible bond divided by the number of shares received if the bond is converted.\n\n- Assume a convertible bond with a $1000 face value and a conversion ratio of 15.\n- If you convert the bond into stock, you will receive 15 shares.\n- If you do not convert, you will receive 1000.\n- By converting you essentially “pay” 1000 for 15 shares, implying a price per share of 66.67.\n- If the price of the stock exceeds 66.67, you will choose to convert; otherwise, you will take the cash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\nA credit rating is an **opinion of the general creditworthiness of either an issuer or one of the specific issues made by the issuer.**\n\nThese *opinions* represent the default risk of a security.\n\nThere are many factors that affect a credit rating.\n\n- Industry-level factors\n- Firm-level factors\n- Security-level factors\n- Firm's financial analysis and quality\n- Etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\nRatings are constructed to represent the risk of default.\n\n- A high (low) rating implies a low (high) probability of default.\n- Default refers to any event that results in the issuer’s breaching its financial contract.\n  - **Minor default:** failing to meet a contracted financial ratio.\n  - **Serious default:** failure to make an interest or principal payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n**Three main players:**\n\n- Moody's\n- Standard & Poor's\n- Fitch\n\nThey make money: \n\n- \"Selling\" a rating:\n- Selling softwares to access information.\n\n**There is an idea that _\"not having a rating is worse than having poor rating\"_.**\n\n  - Do you agree?\n\n- Short video: [The Big Short]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xZx1lf2tvs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n<center>\n![](figs/ratings_theeconomist.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n![](figs/ratings.png)\n\nInvestment grad ~= Speculative grade ~= Default.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings [Link](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/200625-credit-trends-global-corporate-debt-market-state-of-play-in-2020-11546901) {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"} \n\n![](figs/ratings_dist.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n<center>\n![](figs/Default_rates.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings and the cost of capital {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\n<center>\n![](figs/Spreads.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Rating process  {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\n- Rating agency meets with company management (CFO & CEO).\n- A team of analysts is assigned to the transaction to review the offering documents, financial statements, the terms of the proposed offering, use of proceeds, historical and pro forma financial analysis, competitive analysis, capital-expenditure plans, etc.\n- A recommendation is made to an internal rating committee that votes on the proposed rating.\n- The company is notified and allowed to respond before the rating is released to the media.

The same is true un Brazil.\n\n. . .\n\n![](figs/bm_24_3.png)\n\nTreasury-Inflation-Protected Securities are called **TIPS**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n\n<center>\n![](figs/td1.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n<center>\n![](figs/td2.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.2 Other Types of Debt {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\n- On April 15, 1998, the U.S. Treasury issued a 30-year inflation-indexed note with a coupon of 3 5/8%. \n- On the date of issue, the consumer price index (C P I ) was 161.740. \n- On April 15, 2012, the C P I had increased to 229.177. \n- What coupon payment was made on April 18, 2012\n\n**Solution**\n\n- Between the issue date and April 15, 2012, the CPI appreciated by $\\frac{229.177}{161.740}=41.695\\%$. \n- Consequently, the principal amount of the bond increased to $1000 \\times 1.41695 = 1416.95$\n- The semiannual coupon payment was $1416.95 \\times \\frac{0.003625}{2} = 25.68$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.2 Other Types of Debt {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n**Municipal Bonds (Munis)**\n\n- Bonds issued by state and local governments.\n- They are not taxable at the federal level (and sometimes at the state and local level as well).\n- Sometimes referred to as tax-exempt bonds.\n- Not common in Brazil. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.2 Other Types of Debt {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n**Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)**\n\n- Securities made up of other financial securities. Security’s cash flows come from the cash flows of the underlying financial securities that “back” it.\n\n**Asset Securitization**: The process of creating an asset-backed security.\n\n**Mortgage-Backed Security**: Largest ABS market. Backed by home mortgages. Often they are guaranteed against default risk by the U.S. government. \n\n- When homeowners in the underlying mortgages make their mortgage payments, this cash goes (minus servicing fees) to the holders of the mortgage-backed security.\n\n- Private organizations, such as banks, also issue ABS. These securities can be backed by home mortgages or other kinds of consumer loans such as automobile loans and credit card receivables. \n\n- When banks re-securitize asset-backed and other fixed income securities, the new asset-backed security is known as a **collateralized debt obligation (CDO)**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.smaller background=\"#FFD6A4\"}\n\n![](figs/cmo.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n# 24.3 Bond Covenants {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n## 24.3 Bond Covenants {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Restrictive clauses in a bond contract that limit the issuers from undercutting their ability to repay the bonds**.\n\nFor example, covenants may:\n\n - Restrict the ability of management to pay dividends\n - Restrict the level of further indebtedness\n - Specify that the issuer must maintain a minimum amount of working capital\n\n. . .\n\nThere are: positive and negative covenants\n\n- **Positive**: the firm must do something (keep specific financial ratios, pay taxes and other obligations, etc)\n\n- **Negative**: the firm must not do something (sell specific assets, pay too much dividend, etc)\n\n\nCovenants are a common feature of bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n \nA bond issuer typically **repays its bonds by making coupon and principal payments** as specified in the bond contract. **However**, the issuer can:\n\n- Repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the market.\n- Make a tender offer for the entire issue.\n- Exercise a call provision.\n\n. . .\n\n**Callable Bonds**: Bonds that contain a call provision that allows the issuer to repurchase the bonds at a predetermined price.\n\n**Call provisions**: Allows the issuer of the bond the right (not obligation) to retire all outstanding bonds on (or after) a specific date, for the call price. The call price is generally set at or above, and expressed as a \\% of face value (e.g..102\\% of face value).\n\n. . . \n\n- A firm may choose to call a bond issue if interest rates have fallen.\n- The issuer can lower its borrowing costs by exercising the call on the callable bond and then immediately refinancing the issue at a lower rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Callable Bonds**\n\n- Holders of callable bonds understand that the issuer will exercise the call option only when the coupon rate of the bond exceeds the prevailing market rate.\n- If a bond is called, investors must reinvest the proceeds when market rates are lower than the coupon rate they are currently receiving.\n- This makes callable bonds relatively less attractive to bondholders than identical non-callable bonds.\n- A callable bond will trade at a lower price (and therefore a higher yield) than an otherwise equivalent non-callable bond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Sinking Fund**\n\n- A method of repaying a bond in which a company makes regular payments into a fund administered by a trustee over the life of the bond.\n- These payments are then used to repurchase bonds.\n- This allows the firm to retire some of the outstanding debt without affecting the cash flows of the remaining bonds.\n\n- The trust can either repurchase the bonds in the market (if the price is below the face value) or by lottery at the par (if the price is above face value).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 24.4 Repayment  Provisions {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Convertible Bond**: A corporate bond with a provision that gives the bondholder an option to convert each bond owned into a fixed number of shares of common stock.\n\n**Conversion Ratio**:  The number of shares received upon conversion of a convertible bond, usually stated per $1000 of face value.\n\n**Conversion Price**: The face value of a convertible bond divided by the number of shares received if the bond is converted.\n\n- Assume a convertible bond with a $1000 face value and a conversion ratio of 15.\n- If you convert the bond into stock, you will receive 15 shares.\n- If you do not convert, you will receive 1000.\n- By converting you essentially “pay” 1000 for 15 shares, implying a price per share of 66.67.\n- If the price of the stock exceeds 66.67, you will choose to convert; otherwise, you will take the cash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\nA credit rating is an **opinion of the general creditworthiness of either an issuer or one of the specific issues made by the issuer.**\n\nThese *opinions* represent the default risk of a security.\n\nThere are many factors that affect a credit rating.\n\n- Industry-level factors\n- Firm-level factors\n- Security-level factors\n- Firm's financial analysis and quality\n- Etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\nRatings are constructed to represent the risk of default.\n\n- A high (low) rating implies a low (high) probability of default.\n- Default refers to any event that results in the issuer’s breaching its financial contract.\n  - **Minor default:** failing to meet a contracted financial ratio.\n  - **Serious default:** failure to make an interest or principal payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n**Three main players:**\n\n- Moody's\n- Standard & Poor's\n- Fitch\n\nThey make money: \n\n- \"Selling\" a rating:\n- Selling softwares to access information.\n\n**There is an idea that _\"not having a rating is worse than having poor rating\"_.**\n\n  - Do you agree?\n\n- Short video: [The Big Short]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xZx1lf2tvs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n<center>\n![](figs/ratings_theeconomist.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n![](figs/ratings.png)\n\nInvestment grad ~= Speculative grade ~= Default.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings [Link](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/200625-credit-trends-global-corporate-debt-market-state-of-play-in-2020-11546901) {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"} \n\n![](figs/ratings_dist.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\"}\n\n<center>\n![](figs/Default_rates.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ratings and the cost of capital {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\n<center>\n![](figs/Spreads.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Rating process  {.smaller  background=\"#96ffa8\" }\n\n- Rating agency meets with company management (CFO & CEO).\n- A team of analysts is assigned to the transaction to review the offering documents, financial statements, the terms of the proposed offering, use of proceeds, historical and pro forma financial analysis, competitive analysis, capital-expenditure plans, etc.\n- A recommendation is made to an internal rating committee that votes on the proposed rating.\n- The company is notified and allowed to respond before the rating is released to the media.
