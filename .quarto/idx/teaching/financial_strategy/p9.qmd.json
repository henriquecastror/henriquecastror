Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\nAn important consequence of leverage is the **risk of bankruptcy**.\n\n- Equity financing does not carry this risk.\n\n- Although equity holders hope to receive dividends, the firm is not legally obligated to pay them.\n\n**Financial Distress**\n\n- When a firm has difficulty meeting its debt obligations: payment delay or default.\n\n**Default**\n\n- When a firm fails to make the required interest or principal payments on its debt or violates a debt covenant (see next slide).\n\n- After the firm defaults, debt holders are given certain rights to the assets of the firm and may even take legal ownership of the firm’s assets through bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf. Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n- **Debt covenants** are restrictions that lenders (creditors, debt holders, investors) put on lending agreements to limit the actions of the borrower (debtor).\n\n- In other words, debt covenants are agreements between a company and its lenders that the company will operate within certain rules set by the lenders.\n\n- They are also called banking covenants or financial covenants.\n\n**When a debt covenant is violated**, depending on the severity, the lender can do several things:\n\n- Demand penalty payment.\n- Increase the predetermined interest rate.\n- Increase the amount of collateral.\n- Demand full immediate repayment of the loan.\n- Terminate the debt agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf. Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**Positive debt covenants** are covenants that state what the borrower **must do**.\n\n- Achieve a certain threshold in certain financial ratios.\n- Ensure facilities and factories are in good working condition.\n- Perform regular maintenance of capital assets.\n- Provide yearly audited financial statements.\n- Ensure accounting practices are in accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf. Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**Negative debt covenants** are covenants that state what the borrower **cannot do**.\n\n- Pay cash dividends over a certain amount or predetermined threshold.\n- Sell certain assets.\n- Borrow more debt.\n- Issue debt more senior than the current debt.\n- Enter into certain types of agreements or leases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf. Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**Example** \n\nLet's discuss an example of default.\n\nArmin is considering a new project.\n\n- Although the new product represents a significant advance over Armin’s competitors’ products, the **product’s success is uncertain**.\n- If it is a hit, revenues and profits will grow, and Armin will be worth **150 million** at the end of the year.\n- If it fails, Armin will be worth only **80 million**.\n\n. . .\n\nArmin may employ one of two alternative capital structures:\n\n- It can use **all-equity financing**.\n- It can use **debt that matures at the end of the year** with a total of **100 million due**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf.

Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\nNote, the decline in value **is not caused by bankruptcy:** \n\n**The decline is the same whether or not the firm has leverage.**\n\n- If the new product fails, Armin will experience **economic distress**, which is a significant decline in the value of a firm’s assets, whether or not it experiences **financial distress** due to leverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf. Mkt {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\nThe takeaway of first subsection is:\n\n\n**With perfect capital markets, Modigliani-Miller (MM) Proposition I applies: The total value to all investors does not depend on the firm’s capital structure.**\n\n- There is no disadvantage to debt financing, and a firm will have the same total value and will be able to raise the same amount initially from investors with either choice of capital structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.1 Default and Bankruptcy in Perf.

Distress {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\nWith perfect capital markets, the risk of bankruptcy is not a disadvantage of debt; rather, **bankruptcy shifts the ownership of the firm from equity holders to debt holders without changing the total value available to all investors** (this is basically the previous section).\n\n. . .\n\n**In reality, the bankruptcy process is complex, time-consuming, and costly.**\n\n- Costly outside experts are often hired by the firm to assist with the bankruptcy.\n\n- Creditors also incur similar costs during the bankruptcy process. \n   - They may wait several years to receive payment.\n   - They may hire their own experts for legal and professional advice.\n\n. . .\n\nThe **direct costs of bankruptcy** reduce the value of the assets that the firm’s investors will ultimately receive.\n\n- The average direct costs of bankruptcy are approximately **3% to 4% of the pre-bankruptcy market value of total assets**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.2 Bankruptcy Costs & Fin.

Then, the costs of financial distress increase, reducing the value of the levered firm.\n\n. . .\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n**The Tradeoff theory states that firms should increase their leverage until it reaches the level for which the firm value is maximized.**  At this point, the tax savings that result from increasing leverage are perfectly offset by the increased probability of incurring the costs of financial distress.\n\n\n![](figs/thanos.png) \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.4 The Tradeoff Theory {.smaller  background=\"#FFF3A6\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\nHolland, Inc. is considering adding leverage to its capital structure.

However, they also recognize that higher debt increases the risk of financial distress. Based on simulations of the firm’s future cash flows, the CFO has made the following estimates (in millions of dollars):\n\n. . .\n\n|Debt                   | 0 | 10  | 20  | 30   |  40  | 50|  \n|-----------------------|---|---- |-----|------|------|----|\n| PV(Int.

Therefore, Ross is likely to work harder, and the firm will be worth more because he will receive 100% of the increase in firm value.\n\n- However, **if Ross sells new shares**, he will only retain 60% ownership and only receive 60% of the increase in firm value.\n- With leverage, Ross retains 100% ownership and will bear the full cost of any “perks,” like country club memberships or private jets.\n- **By selling equity, Ross bears only 60% of the perks cost**; the other 40% will be paid for by the new equity holders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.6 The Agency Benefits of Leverage {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Reduction of Wasteful Investment**\n\n- Another concern for large corporations is that managers may make large, **unprofitable investments**.\n- Managers may engage in **empire building**.\n- Managers often prefer to run larger firms rather than smaller ones, so they will take on investments that increase the size, but not necessarily the profitability, of the firm. \n- Thus, managers may **expand unprofitable divisions**, **pay too much for acquisitions**, make **unnecessary capital expenditures**, or hire **unnecessary employees**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.6 The Agency Benefits of Leverage {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Managerial Overconfidence**\n\n- Managers may over-invest because they are **overconfident**. \n- Managers tend to be bullish on the firm’s prospects and may believe that new opportunities are better than they actually are.\n- **Debt forces managers to be more realistic** with the true prospects of the firm because they have the commitment to pay back debtholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.6 The Agency Benefits of Leverage {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Free Cash Flow Hypothesis**\n\n- The view that **wasteful spending is more likely to occur when firms have high levels of cash flow in excess** of what is needed after making all positive-NPV investments and payments to debt holders.\n- **When cash is tight, managers will be motivated to run the firm as efficiently as possible**.\n- **Leverage increases firm value because it commits the firm to making future interest payments**, thereby reducing excess cash flows and wasteful investment by managers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.6 The Agency Benefits of Leverage {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\nThe takeaway of this section is:\n\n**Leverage also has benefits that might increase firm value.**\n\n**The net effect is an empirical matter and is not trivial to find.**\n\n. . .\n\n**Firms would pursue an optimal debt level.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 16.7 Agency Costs and the TT {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n## 16.7 Agency Costs and the TT {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\nWe can now write that:\n\n$$V^L = V^U + PV(Interest\\;tax\\;shield) - PV(Financial\\;distress\\;costs)$$ \n$$- PV(Agency\\;costs\\;of\\;debt) + PV(Agency\\;benefits\\;of\\;debt)$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n![](figs/bm_16_2.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.7 Agency Costs and the TT {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**The Optimal Debt Level**\n\nAgain, the optimal level is not the same to all firms.\n\n**R&D-Intensive Firms**\n\n- Firms with high R&D costs and future growth opportunities typically maintain low debt levels.\n- These firms tend to have low current free cash flows and risky business strategies.\n\n**Low-Growth, Mature Firms**\n\n- Mature, low-growth firms with stable cash flows and tangible assets often carry a high-debt load. \n- These firms tend to have high free cash flows with few good investment opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Asymmetric Information**\n\n- A situation in which parties have different information. For example, when managers have superior information to investors regarding the firm’s future cash flows.\n\n. . .\n\n**Signaling Theory of Debt**\n\n- The use of leverage as a way to signal information to investors.\n- Thus a firm can use leverage as a way to convince investors that it does have information that the firm will grow, even if it cannot provide verifiable details about the sources of growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Adverse Selection** : The idea that when the buyers and sellers have different information, the average quality of assets in the market will differ from the average quality overall.\n\n**Lemons Principle**\n\n- When a seller has private information about the value of a good, buyers will discount the price they are willing to pay due to adverse selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- An example of adverse selection and the lemons principle is the **used car market**.\n\n- If the seller has private information about the quality of the car, then **her desire to sell reveals the car is probably of low quality**.\n\n- Buyers are therefore reluctant to buy except at heavily discounted prices.\n\n- **Owners of high-quality cars are reluctant to sell** because they know buyers will think they are selling a lemon and offer only a low price.\n\n- Consequently, **the quality and prices of cars sold in the market are both low**.\n\n\n\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\nThis same principle can be applied to **the market for equity**.\n\n- Firms that sell new equity have **private information about the quality of the future projects**.\n- However, due to the lemons principle, **buyers are reluctant to believe management’s assessment** of the new projects and are only willing to buy the new equity at heavily discounted prices.\n\n. . . \n\nIn other words,\n\n**If the firm is issuing equity at market prices, it must be that managers think the stock is expensive.**\n\n**If the firm is buying back shares at market prices, it must be that managers think the stock is cheap.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\nYou are an analyst who follows Great Windows’ stock. Although the current stock price is 37.50, you believe the stock is worth either 25 or 50, depending on the success of a new product launch. \n\nIf Great Windows’ CEO announces that she plans to buy 10,000 additional shares in the company, how will the share price change?\n\n. . .\n\n**Solution**\n\nIf the CEO knows the new product launch is a failure, she would sell the stock at 37.50 given that the she knows true value is 25. \n\nIf the CEO announces that she is buying 10,000 additional shares, she must know that the new product launch is a success and the true value is 50 per share. Thus, the stock price should rise to 50. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**The Pecking Order of Financing Choices**\n\n- Firms prefer to finance investments with internally-generated funds.\n- If external finance is required, firms issue the safest security first.\n- They start with debt, then possibly hybrid securities, such as convertible bonds, then equity as a last resort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\n- Nesbat Industries needs to raise 25 million for a new investment project. If the firm issues one year debt, it may have to pay an interest rate of 10%, although Nesbat’s managers believe that 8% would be a fair rate given the level of risk. \n\n- However, if the firm issues equity, they believe the equity may be underpriced by 7.5%. \n\n- What is the cost to current shareholders of financing the project out of retained earnings, debt, and equity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 16.8 Asymmetric Info. and Cap. Struc. {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Solution**\n\n- If the firm spends 25 million out of retained earnings, rather than paying that money out to shareholders as a dividend, the cost to shareholders is 25 million. \n\n. . .\n\n- Using debt costs the firm $25 \\times 1.10 = 27.5$  million in one year, which has a present value based on management’s view of the firm’s risk of $\\frac{27.5}{1.08} = 25.46$\n\n. . .\n\n- Finally, if equity is underpriced by 7.5%, then to raise 25 million, the firm will need to issue $\\frac{25}{1-0.075} = 27.03$ million of new equity. Thus, the cost to existing shareholders will be 27.03 million. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#  16.9 The Bottom Line {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n## 16.9 The Bottom Line {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n::: {.incremental}\n\n1) With **perfect capital markets**, a firm’s security choice alters the risk of the firm’s equity, but it does not change its value or the amount it can raise from outside investors\n\n2) The optimal capital structure depends on **market imperfections**, such as taxes, financial distress costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information.\n   - the most clear-cut, and possibly the most significant, is **taxes**\n\n3) **Financial distress** may lead to other consequences that reduce the value of the firm\n\n4) **Agency costs and benefits** of leverage are also important determinants of capital structure.\n\n5) A firm must also consider the potential **signaling and adverse selection**  consequences of its financing choice\n\n6) Actively changing a firm’s capital structure entails **transactions costs**.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now it is your turn... {.smaller background=\"#191f36\"}\n\n::: footer\n:::\n\n\n\n## Practice {.smaller background=\"#465280\"}\n\n\n::: {.callout}\nRemember to solve:\n\n- [Questions T/F](https://henriquemartins.net/teaching/financial_strategy/p9tf.html){preview-link=\"true\"} \n- [Questions Numeric](https://henriquemartins.net/teaching/financial_strategy/p9num.html){preview-link=\"true\"} \n\n:::\n\n::: footer\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Interact {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"henriquecastror/EF202401\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOLJQ8yQ\"\n        data-mapping=\"number\"\n        data-term=\"15\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"bottom\"\n        data-theme=\"light\"\n        data-lang=\"en\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n\n\n::: footer\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **THANK YOU!** {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n![](figs/qa2.png){width=150% heigth=150%}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Henrique C.
