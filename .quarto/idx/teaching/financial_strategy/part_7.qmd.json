Each scenario has a **50%** probability of occurrence. The NPV is:\n\n$$NPV = -800 + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1400 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 900 }{1.15} = 200$$\n\n$$PV(CF) = \\frac{1150}{1.15} = 1000$$\n\n. . .\n\nSo the firm value today is **\\$1000**. If the firm wants to finance the project all-equity, it could raise this amount selling equity. In this case, the firm is **unlevered equity**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.1 Equity Versus Debt Financing {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\nThe expected return on the unlevered equity is 15%.\n\n| Date 0 (investment) | Date 1 (strong economy) | Date 1 (Weak economy) |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 1000                | 1400                    | 900                   |\n| Return              | +40%                    | -10%                  |\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 40\\% + \\frac{1}{2} \\times -10\\% = 15\\%$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.1 Equity Versus Debt Financing {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\nLet's now analyse the case where the firm issues 500 of debt and 500 of equity. This firm is **levered equity**. The debt cost is **5%**. **Do the NPV and the firm value change?**\n\n. . .\n\nBecause the firm needs to pay debt holders no matter the state of the economy, we can say that **Debt value in Date 1 is 525 (**$500 \\times 1.05$).\n\n. . .\n\nBecause we know the firm value in each state of the economy, we can say that the difference between the firm value and the debt value is the equity value: $V - D = E$, i.e. $1400 - 525 = 875$ or $900 - 525 = 375$.\n\n. . .\n\nThen, we can write:\n\n| Source     | Date 0 (investment) | Date 1 (strong economy) | Date 1 (Weak economy) |\n|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Debt (D)   | 500                 | 525                     | 525                   |\n| Equity (E) | ?                   | 875                     | 375                   |\n| Firm (V)   | 1000                | 1400                    | 900                   |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.1 Equity Versus Debt Financing {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\n**Wait, but if debt cost is only 5%, why the firm value still is 1.000?

Let r be LVI's cost of capital without leverage. Then we can value LVI as a perpetuity:\n\n$$P = 7.50 = \\frac{Div}{R_u} = \\frac{EPS}{R_u} = \\frac{1}{R_u}$$\n\nTherefore, current stock price implies that $R_u = \\frac{1}{7.50} = 13.33\\%$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\n-   The market value of LVI without leverage is 7.50 × 10 million shares = 75 million.\n-   If LVI uses debt to repurchase 15 million worth of the firm's equity\n-   then the remaining equity will be worth 75 million − 15million = 60 million.\n\nAfter the transaction, $\\frac{D}{E} = \\frac{1}{4}$, thus, we can write:\n\n$$R_e= R_u +\\frac{D}{E} \\times (R_u - R_d) = 13.33 + 0.25 \\times (13.33 - 8) = 14.66$$\n\nGiven that expected EPS is now 1.10 per share, the new value of the shares equals\n\n$$P=\\frac{1.10}{14.66} = 7.50$$\n\nThus, even though EPS is higher, due to the additional risk, shareholders will demand a higher return. **These effects cancel out, so the price per share is unchanged.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\nBecause the **firm's earnings per share and price-earnings ratio are affected by leverage, we cannot reliably compare these measures across firms with different capital structures**.\n\nThe same is true for accounting-based performance measures such as return on equity (ROE).\n\nTherefore, most analysts prefer to use performance measures and valuation multiples that are based on the firm's earnings before interest has been deducted.\n\n-   For example, the ratio of enterprise value to EBIT (or EBITDA) is more useful when analyzing firms with very different capital structures than is comparing their P/E ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\n**Equity Issuances and Dilution**\n\nIt is sometimes (incorrectly) argued that issuing equity will dilute existing shareholders' ownership, so debt financing should be used instead.\n\n-   Dilution: An increase in the total of shares that will divide a fixed amount of earnings\n\nSuppose Jet Sky Airlines (JSA) currently has no debt and 500 million shares of stock outstanding, which is currently trading at a price of \\$16.\n\nLast month the firm announced that it would expand and the expansion will require the purchase of \\$1 billion of new planes, which will be financed by issuing new equity.\n\n-   The current (prior to the issue) value of the equity and the assets of the firm is 8 billion.\n    -   500 million shares × 16 per share = 8 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\nSuppose now JSA sells 62.5 million new shares at the current price of 16 per share to raise the additional 1 billion needed to purchase the planes.\n\n| Assets          | Before | After |\n|-----------------|--------|-------|\n| Cash            |        | 1000  |\n| Existing assets | 8000   | 8000  |\n| Total Value     | 8000   | 9000  |\n| \\# shares (out) | 500    | 562.5 |\n| Value per share | 16     | 16    |\n\n**Result: share prices don't change.

Use MM proposition I and II to show that the increase in expected EPS for LVI will not lead to an increase in the share price.\n\n**Solution**\n\nWithout leverage, expected earnings per share and therefore dividends are 1 each year, and the share price 7.50. Let r be LVI's cost of capital without leverage. Then we can value LVI as a perpetuity:\n\n$$P = 7.50 = \\frac{Div}{R_u} = \\frac{EPS}{R_u} = \\frac{1}{R_u}$$\n\nTherefore, current stock price implies that $R_u = \\frac{1}{7.50} = 13.33\\%$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\n-   The market value of LVI without leverage is 7.50 × 10 million shares = 75 million.\n-   If LVI uses debt to repurchase 15 million worth of the firm's equity\n-   then the remaining equity will be worth 75 million − 15million = 60 million.\n\nAfter the transaction, $\\frac{D}{E} = \\frac{1}{4}$, thus, we can write:\n\n$$R_e= R_u +\\frac{D}{E} \\times (R_u - R_d) = 13.33 + 0.25 \\times (13.33 - 8) = 14.66$$\n\nGiven that expected EPS is now 1.10 per share, the new value of the shares equals\n\n$$P=\\frac{1.10}{14.66} = 7.50$$\n\nThus, even though EPS is higher, due to the additional risk, shareholders will demand a higher return. **These effects cancel out, so the price per share is unchanged.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\nBecause the **firm's earnings per share and price-earnings ratio are affected by leverage, we cannot reliably compare these measures across firms with different capital structures**.\n\nThe same is true for accounting-based performance measures such as return on equity (ROE).\n\nTherefore, most analysts prefer to use performance measures and valuation multiples that are based on the firm's earnings before interest has been deducted.\n\n-   For example, the ratio of enterprise value to EBIT (or EBITDA) is more useful when analyzing firms with very different capital structures than is comparing their P/E ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\n**Equity Issuances and Dilution**\n\nIt is sometimes (incorrectly) argued that issuing equity will dilute existing shareholders' ownership, so debt financing should be used instead.\n\n-   Dilution: An increase in the total of shares that will divide a fixed amount of earnings\n\nSuppose Jet Sky Airlines (JSA) currently has no debt and 500 million shares of stock outstanding, which is currently trading at a price of \\$16.\n\nLast month the firm announced that it would expand and the expansion will require the purchase of \\$1 billion of new planes, which will be financed by issuing new equity.\n\n-   The current (prior to the issue) value of the equity and the assets of the firm is 8 billion.\n    -   500 million shares × 16 per share = 8 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 14.4 Capital Structure Fallacies {.smaller background=\"#c9f7ba\"}\n\nSuppose now JSA sells 62.5 million new shares at the current price of 16 per share to raise the additional 1 billion needed to purchase the planes.\n\n| Assets          | Before | After |\n|-----------------|--------|-------|\n| Cash            |        | 1000  |\n| Existing assets | 8000   | 8000  |\n| Total Value     | 8000   | 9000  |\n| \\# shares (out) | 500    | 562.5 |\n| Value per share | 16     | 16    |\n\n**Result: share prices don't change.
