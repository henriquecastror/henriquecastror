the best-fitting line. \n\n- Such deviations from the best-fitting line result from risk that is not related to the market as a whole. \n\n- These deviations are zero on average in the graph, as the points above the line balance out the points below the line. \n\n- They represent **firm-specific risk** that is diversifiable and that averages out in a large portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 12.3

$\\epsilon_i$ is the error term or the residual. It represents the deviation from the best-fitting line and is zero on average (or else we could improve the fit). This error term corresponds to the diversifiable risk of the stock, which is the risk that is uncorrelated with the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 12.3 Beta Estimation {.smaller  background=\"#ced8f5\"}\n\n- $\\alpha_i$ is the constant term.
