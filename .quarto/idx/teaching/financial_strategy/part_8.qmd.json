Once at the corporate level and then investors are taxed again when they receive their interest or divided payment.*\n\n. . .\n\nTherefore, personal taxes have the potential to **offset some of the corporate tax benefits** of leverage. So, to determine the true tax benefit of leverage, we need to evaluate the **combined effect of both corporate and personal taxes**.\n\n**For individuals:**\n\n- Interest payments received from debt are taxed as income.\n- Equity investors must pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.\n  -

With personal taxes the firm’s equity and debt costs of capital will adjust to compensate investors for their respective tax burdens. \n  - The net result is that a personal tax disadvantage for debt causes the WACC to decline more slowly with leverage than it otherwise would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\nConsider the stylized Brazilian case and compute the **effective tax advantage of debt**. \n\n- Personal tax rate: $\\tau_i$ = 27.5%\n- Equity income tax rate: $\\tau_e$ = 15%\n- Corporate tax rate: $\\tau_c$ = 39%\n\n. . .\n\n\n$$\\tau^* = 1-\\frac{(1-0.39)\\times(1-0.15)}{(1-0.275)} = 28.5\\%$$\n\n**What does it mean?**\n\n- Every 1 received after taxes by debt holders from interest payments costs equity holders 0.28 on an after-tax basis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Do Firms Prefer Debt?**\n\n- When firms raise new capital from investors, they do so primarily by issuing debt.\n- In most years, aggregate equity issues are negative, meaning that on average, firms are reducing the amount of equity outstanding by buying shares (**see next slide**).\n- Firms seem to prefer to finance investments using retained earnings (as Capex figures are greater than debt and equity issuance)\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n  \n![](figs/bm_15_5.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- For the average firm, the result is that debt as a fraction of firm value has varied in a range from 30% to 45%.\n\n![](figs/bm_15_6.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- The use of debt varies greatly by industry.\n- Firms in growth industries like biotechnology or high technology carry very little debt, while airlines, automakers, utilities, and financial firms have high leverage ratios.\n\n\n. . . \n\nAdditionally, most firms hold huge amounts of cash, **actually making net debt negative**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Considering all the tax benefits of debt, why is that firms do not use more debt?**\n\n- To answer this, we need to evaluate the limits to the tax benefit.\n\n. . . \n\n**Taxable earnings**\n\nTo receive the full tax benefits of leverage, a firm need not use 100% debt financing, but the firm does need to have **taxable earnings**.\n\n- This constraint may limit the amount of debt needed as a tax shield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- The optimal level of leverage from a tax saving perspective is the level such that **interest equals EBIT**.\n\n  - Growing firms usually have no taxable earnings and therefore do not use much debt.\n   \n- At the optimal level of leverage, **the firm shields all of its taxable income**, and it does not have any tax-disadvantaged excess interest.\n\n   - However, it is unlikely that a firm can predict its future EBIT (and the optimal level of debt) precisely. \n   - If there is uncertainty regarding EBIT, then there is a risk that interest will exceed EBIT. As a result, the tax savings for high levels of interest falls, possibly reducing the optimal level of the interest payment.\n\n- In general, as a firm’s interest expense approaches its expected taxable earnings, the marginal tax advantage of debt declines, limiting the amount of debt the firm should use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n![](figs/bm_15_8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Last comment: the Low leverage puzzle {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n\n![](figs/bm_15_9.png) \n\n**It seems that firms are under-leveraged consistently.

With personal taxes the firm’s equity and debt costs of capital will adjust to compensate investors for their respective tax burdens. \n  - The net result is that a personal tax disadvantage for debt causes the WACC to decline more slowly with leverage than it otherwise would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\nConsider the stylized Brazilian case and compute the **effective tax advantage of debt**. \n\n- Personal tax rate: $\\tau_i$ = 27.5%\n- Equity income tax rate: $\\tau_e$ = 15%\n- Corporate tax rate: $\\tau_c$ = 39%\n\n. . .\n\n\n$$\\tau^* = 1-\\frac{(1-0.39)\\times(1-0.15)}{(1-0.275)} = 28.5\\%$$\n\n**What does it mean?**\n\n- Every 1 received after taxes by debt holders from interest payments costs equity holders 0.28 on an after-tax basis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Do Firms Prefer Debt?**\n\n- When firms raise new capital from investors, they do so primarily by issuing debt.\n- In most years, aggregate equity issues are negative, meaning that on average, firms are reducing the amount of equity outstanding by buying shares (**see next slide**).\n- Firms seem to prefer to finance investments using retained earnings (as Capex figures are greater than debt and equity issuance)\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n  \n![](figs/bm_15_5.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- For the average firm, the result is that debt as a fraction of firm value has varied in a range from 30% to 45%.\n\n![](figs/bm_15_6.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- The use of debt varies greatly by industry.\n- Firms in growth industries like biotechnology or high technology carry very little debt, while airlines, automakers, utilities, and financial firms have high leverage ratios.\n\n\n. . . \n\nAdditionally, most firms hold huge amounts of cash, **actually making net debt negative**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Considering all the tax benefits of debt, why is that firms do not use more debt?**\n\n- To answer this, we need to evaluate the limits to the tax benefit.\n\n. . . \n\n**Taxable earnings**\n\nTo receive the full tax benefits of leverage, a firm need not use 100% debt financing, but the firm does need to have **taxable earnings**.\n\n- This constraint may limit the amount of debt needed as a tax shield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- The optimal level of leverage from a tax saving perspective is the level such that **interest equals EBIT**.\n\n  - Growing firms usually have no taxable earnings and therefore do not use much debt.\n   \n- At the optimal level of leverage, **the firm shields all of its taxable income**, and it does not have any tax-disadvantaged excess interest.\n\n   - However, it is unlikely that a firm can predict its future EBIT (and the optimal level of debt) precisely. \n   - If there is uncertainty regarding EBIT, then there is a risk that interest will exceed EBIT. As a result, the tax savings for high levels of interest falls, possibly reducing the optimal level of the interest payment.\n\n- In general, as a firm’s interest expense approaches its expected taxable earnings, the marginal tax advantage of debt declines, limiting the amount of debt the firm should use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n![](figs/bm_15_8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Last comment: the Low leverage puzzle {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n\n![](figs/bm_15_9.png) \n\n**It seems that firms are under-leveraged consistently. Therefore, there must be more to this capital structure story (chap. 16).**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Problems {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 1 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q1/\"></iframe>\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 2 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q2/\" ></iframe>\n\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 3 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q3/\" ></iframe>\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 4 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q4/\" ></iframe>\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 5 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q5/\" ></iframe>\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 6 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q6/\" ></iframe>\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 7 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q7/\" ></iframe>\n\n##  {.smaller background=\"#522f31\"}\n\n**Question 8 **\n\n<iframe  height=\"50%\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://hcm.quarto.pub/p8q8/\" ></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Recap {visibility=hidden}\n\n\n## Comments? {background=\"#3974a3\"}\n\n<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"henriquecastror/efcomments-part-8\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOK8EAGg\"\n        data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOK8EAGs4Cb5GU\"\n        data-mapping=\"pathname\"\n        data-strict=\"0\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"bottom\"\n        data-theme=\"light\"\n        data-lang=\"en\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **THANK YOU!** {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n![](figs/qa2.png){width=150% heigth=150%}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Henrique C.
