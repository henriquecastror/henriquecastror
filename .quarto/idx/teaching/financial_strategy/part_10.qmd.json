Because she will own $2,000 − 125 = 1,875$ shares, the investor will receive dividends of $1,875 \\times 4.80 = 9,000$ per year from then on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.2 Dividends vs. Share Repurchases {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n**Homemade Dividends**\n\n**Problem**\n\nYou own 1,000 shares in a firm that has historically paid dividends at a rate of 50% of earnings per share.

The current market price is $50 per share. **How could you create a homemade dividend based on the firm’s dividend history?**\n\n. . . \n\n**Solution**\n\nBased on the firm’s history, its “normal” dividend would have been $\\$5 × 50\\% = 2.50$ per share. To create a homemade dividend, you need to sell enough shares to generate the desired cash flow. This equates to $1,000 shares \\times 2.50 per share = 2,500$. \n\nGiven a current market value of \\$50 per share, you would need to sell $\\frac{2,500}{50}=50$ shares to create the desired homemade dividend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.2 MM and Dividend Policy Irrelevance {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**There is a tradeoff between current and future dividends.**\n\n- If Genron pays a **higher** current dividend, future dividends will be **lower**.\n\n- If Genron pays a **lower** current dividend, future dividends will be **higher**.\n\n![](figs/bm_17_1_div.png)\n\n. . .\n\n**In perfect capital markets, holding fixed the investment policy, the firm’s choice of dividend policy is irrelevant and does not affect the initial share price.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.2 MM and Dividend Policy Irrelevance {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\nFurthermore, shareholders can create a **homemade dividend** by buying or selling shares themselves.\n\n. . .\n\n**What is the main input of the dividend policy?**\n\nA firm’s **free cash flow** determines the level of payouts that it can make to its investors.\n\n- In a perfect capital market, the type of payout is irrelevant.\n- In reality, capital markets are not perfect, and it is these **imperfections** that should determine the firm’s payout policy.\n\n\n. . .\n\n**While dividends do determine share prices, a firm’s choice of dividend policy does not.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#  17.3 The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n## 17.3 The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Taxes on Dividends and Capital Gains**\n\n- Shareholders must **pay taxes on the dividends** they receive, and they must also **pay capital gains taxes** when they sell their shares.\n- Dividends are typically taxed at a higher rate than capital gains. In fact, long-term investors can defer the capital gains tax forever by not selling.\n\n. . .\n\n- The higher tax rate on dividends makes it undesirable for a firm to raise funds to pay a dividend.\n- When dividends are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains, if a firm raises money by issuing shares and then gives that money back to shareholders as a dividend, shareholders are hurt because they will receive less than their initial investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.3 The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\nAssume that:\n\n- A firm raises 25 million from shareholders and uses it to pay  25 million in dividends. \n- Dividends are taxed at a 39% tax rate.

Dividends is a stronger signal in this regard.\n- Also, a firm may announce a share repurchase program but not repurchase any shares. It is not mandatory to buy back shares. But once the firm announces dividends payment, it has to pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n## 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Stock Dividends**\n\n- With a stock dividend, a firm **does not pay out any cash** to shareholders. As a result, the **total market value of the firm’s equity is unchanged**.\n- The only thing that is different is the **number of shares outstanding**. The **stock price will therefore fall** because the same total equity value is now divided over a larger number of shares.\n\n. . . \n\n- Suppose Genron paid a 50\\% stock dividend rather than a cash dividend. \n- A shareholder who owns 100 shares (price = \\$42) before the dividend has a portfolio worth 4,200.  After the dividend, the shareholder owns 150 shares.\n- Because the portfolio is still worth 4,200, the stock price will fall to 28 ($\\frac{4,200}{150}$).\n\n. . . \n\nSometimes, firms finance the new shares. So, it is like the shareholders have received cash and immediately bought new shares. In this case, the decline in price is not as large as above.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Splits**\n\n- The typical motivation for a stock split is to keep the share price in a range thought to be attractive to small investors.\n- If the share price rises “too high,” it might be difficult for small investors to invest in the stock.\n- Keeping the price “low” may make the stock more attractive to small investors and can increase the demand for and the liquidity of the stock, which may in turn boost the stock price.\n- On average, announcements of stock splits are associated with a small positive increase in the stock price.\n\n**Reverse Split (inplit)**\n\n- When the price of a company’s stock falls too low and the company reduces the number of outstanding shares. 2 shares become 1 of twice the previous price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n![](figs/bm_17_8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Spin-Off**\n\n- When a firm sells a subsidiary by selling shares in the subsidiary alone. That is, the parent turns a subsidiary into a separate company.\n- For instance, Itau-XP Spin-off:\n  - Itau could have sold XP and paid cash as dividends.\n  - Instead, Itau's current shareholders received x stocks of XP per share they hold of Itau. \n- Spin-Offs offer two advantages.\n    - It avoids the transaction costs associated with the actual sale.\n    - The special dividend is not taxed as a cash distribution.

Usually, the interest on equity tax rate is lower than the corporate tax rate.\n- Firms have a limit to pay as interest on equity. This limit increases every year by TJLP (an annual interest rate established by Brazilian Central Bank ([Link](https://www.in.gov.br/web/dou/-/comunicado-n-39.215-de-30-de-setembro-de-2022-433423675))).\n- There is a (never ending) ongoing discussion to extinct interest on equity.\n\nInterest on equity used to be an important instrument when inflation rates were very high in Brazil. The goal was to create an incentive to hold equity when inflation was high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#  17.2 Dividends vs. Share Repurchases {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n## 17.2 Dividends vs. Share Repurchases {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n- Consider Genron Corporation.

Because she will own $2,000 − 125 = 1,875$ shares, the investor will receive dividends of $1,875 \\times 4.80 = 9,000$ per year from then on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.2 Dividends vs. Share Repurchases {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n**Homemade Dividends**\n\n**Problem**\n\nYou own 1,000 shares in a firm that has historically paid dividends at a rate of 50% of earnings per share.

The current market price is $50 per share. **How could you create a homemade dividend based on the firm’s dividend history?**\n\n. . . \n\n**Solution**\n\nBased on the firm’s history, its “normal” dividend would have been $\\$5 × 50\\% = 2.50$ per share. To create a homemade dividend, you need to sell enough shares to generate the desired cash flow. This equates to $1,000 shares \\times 2.50 per share = 2,500$. \n\nGiven a current market value of \\$50 per share, you would need to sell $\\frac{2,500}{50}=50$ shares to create the desired homemade dividend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.2 MM and Dividend Policy Irrelevance {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**There is a tradeoff between current and future dividends.**\n\n- If Genron pays a **higher** current dividend, future dividends will be **lower**.\n\n- If Genron pays a **lower** current dividend, future dividends will be **higher**.\n\n![](figs/bm_17_1_div.png)\n\n. . .\n\n**In perfect capital markets, holding fixed the investment policy, the firm’s choice of dividend policy is irrelevant and does not affect the initial share price.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.2 MM and Dividend Policy Irrelevance {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\nFurthermore, shareholders can create a **homemade dividend** by buying or selling shares themselves.\n\n. . .\n\n**What is the main input of the dividend policy?**\n\nA firm’s **free cash flow** determines the level of payouts that it can make to its investors.\n\n- In a perfect capital market, the type of payout is irrelevant.\n- In reality, capital markets are not perfect, and it is these **imperfections** that should determine the firm’s payout policy.\n\n\n. . .\n\n**While dividends do determine share prices, a firm’s choice of dividend policy does not.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#  17.3 The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n## 17.3 The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Taxes on Dividends and Capital Gains**\n\n- Shareholders must **pay taxes on the dividends** they receive, and they must also **pay capital gains taxes** when they sell their shares.\n- Dividends are typically taxed at a higher rate than capital gains. In fact, long-term investors can defer the capital gains tax forever by not selling.\n\n. . .\n\n- The higher tax rate on dividends makes it undesirable for a firm to raise funds to pay a dividend.\n- When dividends are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains, if a firm raises money by issuing shares and then gives that money back to shareholders as a dividend, shareholders are hurt because they will receive less than their initial investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.3 The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\nAssume that:\n\n- A firm raises 25 million from shareholders and uses it to pay  25 million in dividends. \n- Dividends are taxed at a 39% tax rate.

Alternatively, the firm can pay a dividend immediately, and **shareholders can invest the cash on their own**. **In a perfect capital market, which option will shareholders prefer?**\n\n. . .\n\n**Solution**\n\n- If Payne pays an immediate dividend, the shareholders receive 20,000 today.\n- If Payne retains the cash, at the end of one year the company will be able to pay a dividend of 21,000 (20,000 × (1.05) = 21,000)\n- If shareholders invest the 20,000 in Treasury bills themselves, they would have $21,000 at the end of one year (20,000 × (1.05) = 21,000)\n- The present value in either scenario is 20,000\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Taxes and Cash Retention {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\nCorporate taxes make it costly for a firm to retain excess cash. Cash is equivalent to negative leverage, so the tax advantage of leverage implies a tax disadvantage to holding cash.\n\n. . .\n\n**Problem**\n\nWhat if Payne has a marginal tax rate of 39%. Would a tax-exempt endowment prefer that Payne use its excess cash to pay the dividend immediately or invest the cash in a Treasury bill paying 5% interest and then pay out a dividend?\n\n. . .\n\n**Solution**\n\nIf Payne pays a dividend today, shareholders receive 20,000. If Payne retains the cash for one year, it will earn an after-tax return on the Treasury bills of $5\\% \\times (1-0.39)=3.05\\%$\n\nAt the end of the year, Payne will pay a dividend of 20,000 × (1.0305) = 20,610. This amount is less than the 21,000 the endowment would have earned if they had invested the $20,000 in the Treasury bills themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.5 Payout Versus Retention of Cash {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**Adjusting for Investor Taxes**\n\n- The decision to pay out versus retain cash may also affect the taxes paid by shareholders.\n- When a firm retains cash, it must pay corporate tax on the interest it earns.\n- In addition, the investor will owe capital gains tax on the increased value of the firm.\n- In essence, the interest on retained cash is taxed twice.\n\n. . .\n\n- If the firm paid the cash to its shareholders instead, they could invest it and be taxed only once on the interest that they earn.\n  - The cost of retaining cash therefore depends on the combined effect of the corporate and capital gains taxes, compared to the single tax on interest income.\n\n\n\n$$\\tau^*_{retain} = 1-\\frac{(1-\\tau_c)(1-\\tau_g)}{(1-\\tau_i)}$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.5 Payout Versus Retention of Cash {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**Issuance and Distress Costs**\n\nA reason to hold cash:\n\n- Generally, firms retain cash balances to cover potential future cash shortfalls, despite the tax disadvantage to retaining cash.\n- A firm might accumulate a large cash balance if there is a reasonable chance that future earnings will be insufficient to fund future positive-NPV investment opportunities.\n- The **cost of holding cash to cover future potential cash needs** should be compared to the **reduction in transaction, agency, and adverse selection costs of raising new capital** through new debt or equity issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.5 Payout Versus Retention of Cash {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\"}\n\n**Agency Costs of Retaining Cash**\n\nHowever...\n\n- When firms have excessive cash, managers may use the funds inefficiently by paying excessive executive perks, over-paying for acquisitions, etc.\n- Paying out excess cash through dividends or share repurchases, rather than retaining cash, can boost the stock price by **reducing managers’ ability and temptation to waste resources**.\n\n. . .\n\nAt the end of the day:\n\n- Firms should choose to **retain to help with future growth opportunities and to avoid financial distress costs**. \n  - Firms trade off these benefits **against agency costs**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.5 Payout Versus Retention of Cash {.smaller  background=\"#cfd5ea\" visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n**Problem**\n\nAltgreen is an all-equity firm with **250 million shares outstanding**. Altgreen has **300 million in cash** and expects **future free cash flows of 150 million per year**. Management plans to use the cash to expand the firm’s operations, which will in turn **increase future free cash flows by 10%**. If the cost of capital of Altgreen’s investments is **7%**, **how would a decision to use the cash for a share repurchase rather than the expansion change the share price?**\n\n. . .\n\n**Solution**\n\nIf Altgreen uses the cash to expand, its future free cash flows will increase by 10% to **165 million per year**. Using the perpetuity formula, its market value will be $\\frac{165}{0.07} = 2.357$  billion or $\\frac{2.357 bi}{250million\\;shares} = 9.43$ per share.\n\n. . .\n\nIf Altgreen does not expand, the value of its future free cash flows will be $\\frac{150}{0.07} = 2.143 bi$. Adding cash, $2.143 + 0.300 = \\frac{2.443}{250mi} = 9.77$ per share.   \n\n. . . \n\nIf Altgreen repurchases shares, it will repurchase $\\frac{300mil}{9.77}=30.71$ million shares. Price would be $\\frac{2.143bi}{219.29mi}= 9.77$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 17.6 Signaling with Payout Policy {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n \n## 17.6 Signaling with Payout Policy {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Dividend Smoothing**\n\n- The practice of maintaining relatively constant dividends\n  - Firm change dividends infrequently, and dividends are much less volatile than earnings.\n\n![](figs/bm_17_7.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.6 Signaling with Payout Policy {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Dividend Signaling Hypothesis**\n\n- The idea that dividend changes reflect managers’ views about a future earnings.\n- If firms smooth dividends, the firm’s dividend choice will contain information regarding management’s expectations of future earnings.\n\n- When a firm increases dividend, it sends a positive signal to investors that they expect to be able to afford the higher dividend for the foreseeable future.\n- When a firm decreases dividend, it may signal that they have given up hope that earnings will rebound in the near term and so need to save cash.\n\n. . .\n\n**But there is a catch**\n\n- Although an increase of a firm’s dividend may signal optimism regarding its future FCF, it might also signal a lack of investment opportunities.\n- Conversely, a firm might cut dividend to exploit good investment opportunities.\n- In this case, the dividend decrease might lead to a positive stock price reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.6 Signaling with Payout Policy {.smaller  background=\"#eeffff\"}\n\n**Signaling and Share Repurchases**\n\n- Share repurchases are a credible signal that the shares are underpriced, because if they are overpriced a share repurchase is costly for current shareholders.\n- If investors believe that managers have better information regarding the firm’s prospects and act on behalf of current shareholders, then investors will react favorably to share repurchase announcements.\n- But, announcing a share repurchase today does not necessarily represent a long-term commitment to repurchase shares. Dividends is a stronger signal in this regard.\n- Also, a firm may announce a share repurchase program but not repurchase any shares. It is not mandatory to buy back shares. But once the firm announces dividends payment, it has to pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n## 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Stock Dividends**\n\n- With a stock dividend, a firm **does not pay out any cash** to shareholders. As a result, the **total market value of the firm’s equity is unchanged**.\n- The only thing that is different is the **number of shares outstanding**. The **stock price will therefore fall** because the same total equity value is now divided over a larger number of shares.\n\n. . . \n\n- Suppose Genron paid a 50\\% stock dividend rather than a cash dividend. \n- A shareholder who owns 100 shares (price = \\$42) before the dividend has a portfolio worth 4,200.  After the dividend, the shareholder owns 150 shares.\n- Because the portfolio is still worth 4,200, the stock price will fall to 28 ($\\frac{4,200}{150}$).\n\n. . . \n\nSometimes, firms finance the new shares. So, it is like the shareholders have received cash and immediately bought new shares. In this case, the decline in price is not as large as above.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Splits**\n\n- The typical motivation for a stock split is to keep the share price in a range thought to be attractive to small investors.\n- If the share price rises “too high,” it might be difficult for small investors to invest in the stock.\n- Keeping the price “low” may make the stock more attractive to small investors and can increase the demand for and the liquidity of the stock, which may in turn boost the stock price.\n- On average, announcements of stock splits are associated with a small positive increase in the stock price.\n\n**Reverse Split (inplit)**\n\n- When the price of a company’s stock falls too low and the company reduces the number of outstanding shares. 2 shares become 1 of twice the previous price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n![](figs/bm_17_8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs {.smaller  background=\"#ead1dc\"}\n\n**Spin-Off**\n\n- When a firm sells a subsidiary by selling shares in the subsidiary alone. That is, the parent turns a subsidiary into a separate company.\n- For instance, Itau-XP Spin-off:\n  - Itau could have sold XP and paid cash as dividends.\n  - Instead, Itau's current shareholders received x stocks of XP per share they hold of Itau. \n- Spin-Offs offer two advantages.\n    - It avoids the transaction costs associated with the actual sale.\n    - The special dividend is not taxed as a cash distribution. Investors will only pay capital gains taxes when they sell the received stocks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comments? {background=\"#a2bef5\"}\n\n<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"henriquecastror/efcomments-part-10\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOK8BSNQ\"\n        data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOK8BSNc4Cb47J\"\n        data-mapping=\"pathname\"\n        data-strict=\"0\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"bottom\"\n        data-theme=\"light\"\n        data-lang=\"pt\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n\n\n\n\n\n## **THANK YOU!** {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n![](figs/qa2.png){width=150% heigth=150%}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Henrique C.
