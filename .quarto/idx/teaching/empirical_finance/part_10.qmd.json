If children were born on or before December 31, then they were assigned to the first grade. But if their birthday was on or after January 1, they were assigned to kindergarten. *\n\n*Thus two people—one born on December 31 and one born on January 1—were exogenously assigned different grades.*\n\nEveryone is forced to leave school when 16.\n\n\n\n\n## Angrist's example {.smaller background=\"#d2e2fc\"}\n\n[Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/07-instrumental_variables#the-problem-of-weak-instruments)\n\n![](figs/iv3.png)\n\n*Angrist and Krueger had the insight that that small quirk was exogenously assigning more schooling to people born later in the year.*\n\n*The person born in December would reach age 16 with more education than the person born in January*\n\n\n\n\n## Angrist's example {.smaller background=\"#d2e2fc\"}\n\n[Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/07-instrumental_variables#the-problem-of-weak-instruments)\n\n![](figs/iv4.jpg)\n\n\n**What is the instrument here?**\n\n\n\n## Angrist's example {.smaller background=\"#d2e2fc\"}\n\n[Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/07-instrumental_variables#the-problem-of-weak-instruments)\n\n\n**What is the instrument here?**\n\nThe instrument is the quarter of birth.\n\n- People born in the 3rd and 4th quarter receive more education than others due to **compulsory schooling**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Two-stage least squares (2SLS) {.smaller background=\"#abc8f5\"}\n\n## Two-stage least squares  (2SLS){.smaller background=\"#abc8f5\"}\n\n\nOne of the more intuitive instrumental variables estimators is the 2SLS. \n\n\n\n**The first stage is**\n\n$$x_k = \\delta + \\delta_1 z + \\delta_2 x_1 + . . .+ \\delta_n x_n + \\mu$$\n\nThen, you predict $x_k$ using the first stage.\n\n- \"predict\" means that you are finding the \"response\" Y of the equation after estimating the coefficients\n\n $$\\hat{x_k} = \\hat{\\delta} + \\hat{\\delta_1} z + \\hat{\\delta_2} x_1 + . . . + \\hat{\\delta_n} x_n $$\n\n\n. . . \n\nThen, **the second stage** is:\n\n\n$$y = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\hat{x_k} + \\beta_2 x_1 + . . .+  \\beta_n x_n + \\mu$$\n\n\nThe idea using $\\hat{x_k}$ is that it represents only the variation that is not correlated with $\\mu$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Instrumental Variables {.smaller background=\"#abc8f5\"}\n\nWe can write that:\n\n$$\\beta_1= \\frac{Cov(z,y)}{Cov(z,x_k)}$$\n\n\n- It shows that $\\beta_1$ is the population covariance between z and y divided by the population covariance between z and x.\n\n- Notice how this fails if z and x are uncorrelated, that is, if $Cov(z, x) = 0$ \n\n\n\n\n. . . \n\n\n\n$$\\beta_1= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i-\\bar{z})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(z_i-\\bar{z})(x_i-\\bar{x})}$$\n\n\nNotice that if $z$ and $x$ are the same (i.e., perfect correlation), $\\beta_1$ above is the OLS $\\beta$\n\n\n$$\\beta_1= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}$$\n\n\n\n# Weak Instruments  {.smaller background=\"#8da6cc\"}\n\n## Weak Instruments {.smaller background=\"#8da6cc\"}\n\nI did not demonstrate here, but we can say that (see pp; 517-18 Wooldridge):\n\n- though IV is consistent when $z$ and $u$ are uncorrelated and $z$ and $x$ have any positive or negative correlation, IV estimates can have large standard errors, especially if $z$ and $x$ are only weakly correlated.\n\nThis gives rise to the week instruments problem.\n\nWe can write the probability limit of the IV estimator:\n\n$$plim \\hat{\\beta_{iv}} = \\beta_1 + \\frac{Corr(z,\\mu)}{Corr(z,x)} \\times \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mu}}{\\sigma_x}$$\n\nIt shows that, even if $Corr(z,\\mu)$ is small, the inconsistency in the IV estimator can be very large if $Corr(z,x)$ is also small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Weak Instruments {.smaller background=\"#8da6cc\"}\n\nTwo tips:\n\n1) Look at the F-stat of the first-stage. It should not be low.\n\n2) The sign of the coefficient in the first stage should be as expected.\n\n3) Look at the S.E. When the instrument is week, the S.E., are even larger than it should be.\n\n. . .\n\nOne more tip,\n\n4) Avoid computing the first stage by hand, it would give wrong estimates of the S.E. in the second stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Example {.smaller background=\"#95a9c7\"}\n\n## Example  {.smaller background=\"#95a9c7\"}\n\nOLS\n \n::: panel-tabset\n\n### R\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n#| fig-align: center\n#| echo: true\n#| output: true\n#| output-location: default\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n#| eval: true\n#| code-summary: \"R\"\nlibrary(haven)  \ndata <- read_dta(\"files/mroz.dta\")\nmodel <- lm(lwage ~ educ, data = data)\nsummary(model)\n```  \n\n\n### Stata\n\n```{stata}\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n#| fig-align: center\n#| echo: true\n#| output: true\n#| output-location: default\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n#| eval: true\n#| code-summary: \"Stata\"\nuse files/mroz.dta , clear\nreg lwage educ \n```  \n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Example  {.smaller background=\"#95a9c7\"}\n\nThe IV estimate of the return to education is 5.9%, which is barely more than one-half of the  OLS estimate.

You should be happy if you have a good one!**\n\n. . . \n\n\nBut if you do have multiple IVs, you can test their quality...\n\n- If they are all valid, you should get consistent estimates...\n\n- ... even if you use only a subset of them.\n\n- So the test is about how similar the estimates are if you use subsets of IVs.\n\n\n**But this test does not give really an answer about whether the IVs are good.**\n\nThis always come from theory.\n\n\n\n\n## Final Comments {.smaller background=\"#bcd3f7\"}\n\n**Some more comments:**\n\n1) If you have an interaction term between $x_1$ and $x_2$, and $z$ is the instrument for $x_1$, you can \"create\" the instrument $zx_2$ for $x_2$.\n\n. . . \n\n2) GMM uses lagged variables as instruments. But, this is not a good decision if the variables are highly serially correlated.\n\n  - Lagged total assets is not a good instrument for total assets.\n  \n. . . \n\n3) Using the average-group of variable X is also problematic (i.e., the industry average own. concentration as IV of firm-level own. concentration)\n\n - This is no different than a group FE, making hard to believe in the exclusion restriction.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **THANK YOU!** {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n![](figs/qa2.png){width=\"150%\" heigth=\"150%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Henrique C.
