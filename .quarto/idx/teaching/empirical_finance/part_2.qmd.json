The \"second\" term in the following equation:\n\nATET = $\\frac{1}{N} (E[Y_{i,1}|D_i=1] - E[Y_{i,0}|D_i=1])$\n\n\nWe need an empirical design to **\"observe\"** what we do not really observe (i.e., the counterfactual). \n\n\n\n\n\n## Selection Bias {.smaller background=\"#f7e8dc\"}\n\nMany options:\n\n- Matching/Balancing\n- Difference-in-differences (DiD)\n- Instrumental variables\n- Regression discontinuity design (RDD)\n- Synthetic control (Synth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Selection Bias {.smaller background=\"#f7e8dc\"}\n\nThe process of finding units that are comparable is called **matching**.\n\n. . .\n\n**Before we continue...**\n\n**We will match on observables. We cannot be on unobservables.**\n\nThus, you may want to write in your article \"selection bias due to observables\".\n\n. . .\n\n**Cunningham:**\n\n*Propensity score matching has not seen as wide adoption among economists as in other nonexperimental methods like regression discontinuity or difference-in-differences. The most common reason given for this is that economists are oftentimes skeptical that CIA can be achieved in any dataset almost as an article of faith. This is because for many applications, economists as a group are usually more concerned about selection on unobservables than they are selection on observables, and as such, they reach for matching methods less often.*\n\nCIA = CMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Matching  {.smaller background=\"#f2d5bf\"}\n\n## Matching   {.smaller background=\"#f2d5bf\"}\n\n**Matching** aims to compare the outcomes between observations that have the same values of all control variables, except that one unit is treated and the other is not. \n\n. . .\n\nIn this literature, the control variables used to matched are often called **covariates**.\n\nThat is, for each treated unit, the researcher finds an untreated unit that is similar in all covariates.\n\nThe implication is that the researcher can argue that \"*units are comparable after matching*\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Matching   {.smaller background=\"#f2d5bf\"}\n\nThe easiest to see is **exact matching**: *it matches observations that have the exact same values*. \n\n- It might be doable if you have only one covariate. \n\n- Naturally, if you have only one covariate, you might still be left with some selection bias.\n\n  - In the previous example, health history is one important covariate that makes John and Mary different. \n  \n  - But what about life style? Nutrition? Etc. \n  \n\nAs the number of covariates grow, you cannot pursue exact matching. That is the job of PSM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Matching   {.smaller background=\"#f2d5bf\"}\n\n**In exact matching, the causal effect estimator (ATET) is:**\n\n$$ATET = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum (E[Y_{i}] - E[Y_{j(i)}] | D_i=1)$$\n\nWhere $Y_{j(i)}$ is the j-th unit matched to the i-th unit based on the j-th being “closest to” the i-th unit for some  covariate. \n\nFor instance, let’s say that a unit in the treatment group has a covariate with a value of 2 and we find another unit in the control group (exactly one unit) with a covariate value of 2. \n\nThen we will impute the treatment unit’s missing counterfactual with the matched unit’s, and take a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Matching {.smaller background=\"#f2d5bf\"}\n\nConsider the following dataset from Cunningham:\n\n![](figs/scott.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Matching   {.smaller background=\"#f2d5bf\"}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### R Averages\n\nAverage ages are very different.

background=\"#d4b8a3\"}\n\n## Distance Matching  {.smaller background=\"#d4b8a3\"}\n\nThe last example was simple because you could *exact match*.\n\nIf you cannot find one exact match, you need an approximate match. \n\n. . .\n\nIn order to do that, you have to use distance matching.\n\n**Distance matching** minimizes the distance (i.e., how far the covariates are from each other) between the treatment and control groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Distance Matching  {.smaller background=\"#d4b8a3\"}\n\n**Euclidean distance** =

itself depends on the **scale of the variables themselves**. \n\nFor this reason, researchers typically will use some modification of the Euclidean distance, such as the **normalized Euclidean distance**, or they’ll use a wholly different alternative distance. \n\nThe normalized Euclidean distance is a commonly used distance, and what makes it different is that the distance of each variable is scaled by the variable’s variance. \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n## Distance Matching  {.smaller background=\"#d4b8a3\"}\n\n**Mahalanobis  distance** =

Matching  {.smaller background=\"#d4b8a3\"}\n\nDistance matching only goes so far...\n\n... **the larger the dimensionality, the harder is to use distance matching**.\n\nAs sample size increases, for a given N of covariates, the matching discrepancies tend to zero.\n\nBut, the more covariates, the longer it takes.\n\n. . . \n\nAt the end of the day, it is preferable to have many covariates, but it is makes distance matching harder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Coarsened Exact Matching (CER)  {.smaller background=\"#fce0cc\"}\n\n## Coarsened Exact Matching (CER)  {.smaller background=\"#fce0cc\"}\n\nIn coarsened exact matching, something only counts as a match if it exactly matches on each matching variable. \n\n**The “coarsened” part comes in because, if you have any continuous variables to match on, you need to “coarsen” them first by putting them into bins, rather than matching on exact values.**\n\nCoarsening means creating bins. Fewer bins makes exact matches more likely. \n\n. . .\n\nCER is not used much in empirical research in finance. It is used more in the big data realm when you have many variables to match. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Propensity-score matching (PSM)  {.smaller background=\"#f7dfcd\"}\n\n## Propensity-score matching (PSM)  {.smaller background=\"#f7dfcd\"}\n\n**PSM is one way to matching using many covariates.** \n\n**PSM aggregates all covariates into one score (propensity-score), which is the likelihood of receiving the treatment.**\n\nThe idea is to match units that, based on observables, have the same probability (called propensity-score) of being treated. \n\n. . .\n\nThe idea is to estimate a probit (default in stata) or logit model (fist stage):\n\n$$P(D=1|X)$$\n\n**The propensity-score is the predicted probability of a unit being treated given all covariates X**.

neighbor, radius or kernel?\n\n2) With or without replacement?\n\n3) With or without common support?\n\n- *Common support*: imposes a common support by dropping treatment observations whose pscore is higher than the maximum or less than the minimum pscore of the controls.\n\n4) It is expected that, after PSM, you show the overlap of propensity-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Propensity-score matching (PSM)

It is not feasible to have experiments.\n\nThat is why we often explore the idea of \"Natural experiments\" or \"Natural shocks\" (I often use the terms interchangeably)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA **Natural experiment** is an exogenous variation that change a variable in a random subset of firms. \n\n- Regulations, laws, etc.\n- Natural disasters.\n- Sudden death of CEOs or a product, etc.\n- The gender of a newborn.\n\n\nBecause the variation that occur in x is truly exogenous, the CMI holds and thus we can infer causality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA good shock has some conditions [source](https://cfr.pub/published/papers/cfr-0036.pdf):\n\n1) **Shock Strength**: The shock is strong enough to significantly change firm behavior or incentives.\n\n. . .\n \n2) **Exogenous Shock**: The shock came from “outside” the system one is studying.\n\n  - Treated firms did not choose whether to be treated, \n  - cannot anticipate the shock, \n  - the shock is expected to be permanent, and \n  - there is no reason to believe that which firms were treated depends on unobserved firm characteristics.\n  \nIf the shock is exogenous, or appears to be, we are less worried that unobservables might be correlated with both assignment to treatment and the potential outcomes, and thus generate omitted variable bias. \n\nShock exogeneity should be defended, not just assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA good shock has some conditions [source](https://cfr.pub/published/papers/cfr-0036.pdf):\n\n3) **“As If Random” Assignment**: The shock must separate firms into treated and controls in a manner which is close to random.\n\n. . .\n\n4) **Covariate balance:** The forcing and forced variables aside, the shock should produce reasonable covariate balance between treated and control firms, including “common support” (reasonable overlap between treated and control firms on all covariates). \n\nSomewhat imperfect balance can be address with balancing methods, but severe imbalance undermines shock credibility, even if the reason for imbalance is not obvious. Covariate balance should be reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA good shock has some conditions [source](https://cfr.pub/published/papers/cfr-0036.pdf):\n\n5) **Only-Through Condition(s):** We must have reason to believe that the apparent effect of the shock on the outcome came only through the shock (sometimes, through a specific channel). \n\nThe shock must be “isolated”, there must be no other shock, at around the same time, that could also affect treated firms differently than control firms. \nAnd if one expects the shock to affect outcomes through a particular channel, the shock must also affect the outcome only through that channel.\n\n. . .\n\nIn IV analysis, this is called an **“exclusion restriction”** or **“only-through condition\"**, because one assumes away (excludes) other channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nThe idea of a natural shock is often mixed with the difference-in-differences (DiD) design.\n\nIt is more common that it should that people refer to shocks when they want to refer to DiD. \n\nA Did design explores a Natural shock to estimate causal effects.\n\n**A good shock generates, by nature, random assignment**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Remember  {.smaller background=\"#693d3a\"}\n\n**Remember:**\n\nWhen dealing with **causal inference**, we have to find ways to approximate what the hidden potential outcome of the treated units is. \n\nThat is, the challenge in identifying causal effects is that the untreated potential outcomes, $Y_{i,0}$, are never\nobserved for the treated group ($D_i= 1$). The \"second\" term in the following equation:\n\nATET = $\\frac{1}{N} (E[Y_{i,1}|D_i=1] - E[Y_{i,0}|D_i=1])$\n\nWe need an empirical design to **\"observe\"** what we do not really observe (i.e., the counterfactual). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Single differences  {.smaller background=\"#a4baac\"}\n\n## Single differences  {.smaller background=\"#a4baac\"}\n\nThere are two single differences we can use to estimate the causal effect of a treatments (i.e., a shock).\n\n**1) Single Cross-Sectional Differences After Treatment**\n\n**2) Single Time-Series Difference Before and After Treatment**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Single differences  {.smaller background=\"#a4baac\"}\n\n**1) Single Cross-Sectional Differences After Treatment**\n\nOne approach to estimating a parameter that summarizes the treatment effect is to compare the post-treatment outcomes of the treatment and control groups. \n\nThis method is often used when there is no data available on pre-treatment outcomes.\n\nIt takes the form:\n\n$$y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1d_i+\\epsilon$$\n\nwhere $d_i$ is a dummy marking the units that are treated.

sure the shock is random given the firms' levels of leverage.\n\n. . .\n\nIf you may believe that the leverage will change after the treatment, you can use pre-treatment values (interacted with the

observable rule, then controlling for this rule via covariates in the regression satisfies the conditional mean zero assumption required for unbiased estimates.* \n\n*Regardless of the motivation, it is crucial to remember that any covariates included as controls must be unaffected by the treatment, a condition that eliminates other outcome variables and restricts most covariates to pre-treatment values.*\n\n([Roberts and Whited, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-44-453594-8.00007-0))\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n# Comment about DiD {.smaller background=\"#aecfc7\"}\n\n## Comment about DiD  {.smaller

example, if parallel trends holds for dependent variable $Y$, then it doesn’t hold for $ln(y)$, and vice versa*\n\n. . .\n\n*For example, say that in the pre-treatment period $y$ is 10 for the control group and 20 for the treated group. In the post-treatment period, in the counterfactual world where treatment never happened,$y$ would be 15 for the control group and 25 for the treated group.

It is not feasible to have experiments.\n\nThat is why we often explore the idea of \"Natural experiments\" or \"Natural shocks\" (I often use the terms interchangeably)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA **Natural experiment** is an exogenous variation that change a variable in a random subset of firms. \n\n- Regulations, laws, etc.\n- Natural disasters.\n- Sudden death of CEOs or a product, etc.\n- The gender of a newborn.\n\n\nBecause the variation that occur in x is truly exogenous, the CMI holds and thus we can infer causality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA good shock has some conditions [source](https://cfr.pub/published/papers/cfr-0036.pdf):\n\n1) **Shock Strength**: The shock is strong enough to significantly change firm behavior or incentives.\n\n. . .\n \n2) **Exogenous Shock**: The shock came from “outside” the system one is studying.\n\n  - Treated firms did not choose whether to be treated, \n  - cannot anticipate the shock, \n  - the shock is expected to be permanent, and \n  - there is no reason to believe that which firms were treated depends on unobserved firm characteristics.\n  \nIf the shock is exogenous, or appears to be, we are less worried that unobservables might be correlated with both assignment to treatment and the potential outcomes, and thus generate omitted variable bias. \n\nShock exogeneity should be defended, not just assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA good shock has some conditions [source](https://cfr.pub/published/papers/cfr-0036.pdf):\n\n3) **“As If Random” Assignment**: The shock must separate firms into treated and controls in a manner which is close to random.\n\n. . .\n\n4) **Covariate balance:** The forcing and forced variables aside, the shock should produce reasonable covariate balance between treated and control firms, including “common support” (reasonable overlap between treated and control firms on all covariates). \n\nSomewhat imperfect balance can be address with balancing methods, but severe imbalance undermines shock credibility, even if the reason for imbalance is not obvious. Covariate balance should be reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nA good shock has some conditions [source](https://cfr.pub/published/papers/cfr-0036.pdf):\n\n5) **Only-Through Condition(s):** We must have reason to believe that the apparent effect of the shock on the outcome came only through the shock (sometimes, through a specific channel). \n\nThe shock must be “isolated”, there must be no other shock, at around the same time, that could also affect treated firms differently than control firms. \nAnd if one expects the shock to affect outcomes through a particular channel, the shock must also affect the outcome only through that channel.\n\n. . .\n\nIn IV analysis, this is called an **“exclusion restriction”** or **“only-through condition\"**, because one assumes away (excludes) other channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Shocks  {.smaller background=\"#95c9a9\"}\n\nThe idea of a natural shock is often mixed with the difference-in-differences (DiD) design.\n\nIt is more common that it should that people refer to shocks when they want to refer to DiD. \n\nA Did design explores a Natural shock to estimate causal effects.\n\n**A good shock generates, by nature, random assignment**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Remember  {.smaller background=\"#693d3a\"}\n\n**Remember:**\n\nWhen dealing with **causal inference**, we have to find ways to approximate what the hidden potential outcome of the treated units is. \n\nThat is, the challenge in identifying causal effects is that the untreated potential outcomes, $Y_{i,0}$, are never\nobserved for the treated group ($D_i= 1$).

large discrepancy between the treatment effect estimates with and without additional controls raises a red flag.* \n\n*If assignment to treatment and control groups is not random but dictated by an observable rule, then controlling for this rule via covariates in the regression satisfies the conditional mean zero assumption required for unbiased estimates.* \n\n*Regardless of the motivation, it is crucial to remember that any covariates included as controls must be unaffected by the treatment, a condition that eliminates other outcome variables and restricts most covariates to pre-treatment values.*\n\n([Roberts and Whited, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-44-453594-8.00007-0))\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n# Comment about DiD {.smaller background=\"#aecfc7\"}\n\n## Comment about DiD  {.smaller

You should be happy if you have a good one!**\n\n. . . \n\n\nBut if you do have multiple IVs, you can test their quality...\n\n- If they are all valid, you should get consistent estimates...\n\n- ... even if you use only a subset of them.\n\n- So the test is about how similar the estimates are if you use subsets of IVs.\n\n\n**But this test does not give really an answer about whether the IVs are good.**\n\nThis always come from theory.\n\n\n\n\n## Final Comments {.smaller background=\"#bcd3f7\"}\n\n**Some more comments:**\n\n1) If you have an interaction term between $x_1$ and $x_2$, and $z$ is the instrument for $x_1$, you can \"create\" the instrument $zx_2$ for $x_2$.\n\n. . . \n\n2) GMM uses lagged variables as instruments. But, this is not a good decision if the variables are highly serially correlated.\n\n  - Lagged total assets is not a good instrument for total assets.\n  \n. . . \n\n3) Using the average-group of variable X is also problematic (i.e., the industry average own. concentration as IV of firm-level own. concentration)\n\n - This is no different than a group FE, making hard to believe in the exclusion restriction.\n\n\n\n\n## THANK YOU!\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](figs/fgv.png){fig-align=\"right\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n**Henrique Castro Martins**\n\n-
