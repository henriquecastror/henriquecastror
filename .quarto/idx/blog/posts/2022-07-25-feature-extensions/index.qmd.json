There are three types of extensions available:\n\n-   [Shortcodes](../../../extensions/shortcodes.qmd) are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. For example, you could create shortcodes to embed tweets or videos in a document.\n\n-   [Filters](../../../extensions/filters.qmd) are a flexible and powerful tool for introducing new global behaviors and/or new markdown rendering behaviors. For example, you could create filters to implement output folding, an image carousel, or just about anything you can imagine!\n\n-   [Formats](../../../extensions/formats.qmd) enable you to create new output formats by bundling together document options, templates, stylesheets, and other content.\n\nExtensions are a recently released Quarto feature so you should be sure to install the [very latest version](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) of Quarto (at least v1.0.36) if you want to try them out.\n\nHere are some examples of extensions developed and maintained by the core Quarto team:\n\n| **Extension**                                                        | **Description**                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| [lightbox](https://github.com/quarto-ext/lightbox/)                  | Create lightbox treatments for images in your HTML documents.                                   |\n| [code-filename](https://github.com/quarto-ext/code-filename)         | Add a filename header to code blocks.                                                           |\n| [fancy-text](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fancy-text)               | Output nicely formatted versions of fancy strings such as LaTeX and BibTeX in multiple formats. |\n| [fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome)             | Use Font Awesome icons in HTML and PDF documents.                                               |\n| [grouped-tabsets](https://github.com/quarto-ext/grouped-tabsets)     | Add grouped tabsets, which remember the active tab across multiple HTML documents.              |\n| [latex-environment](https://github.com/quarto-ext/latex-environment) | Quarto extension to output custom LaTeX environments.                                           |\n\n: {tbl-colwidths=\"\\[30,70\\]\"}\n\nTo learn more about using extensions, see the [Extensions](../../../extensions/index.qmd) documentation on the Quarto website.
