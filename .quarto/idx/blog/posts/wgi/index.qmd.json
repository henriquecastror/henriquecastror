It contains data since 1996 about the governance of all countries. Governance here is measured by the six following variables:\n\n1. Voice and Accountability\n2. Political Stability and Absence of Violence\n3. Government Effectiveness\n4. Regulatory Quality\n5. Rule of Law\n6. Control of Corruption\n\nBefore we continue, it is important to know what these variables are measuring: they measure Brazilians' **perception** about governance, they do not measure governance per se. Thus, the Government Effectiveness variable, for instance, represents how effective Brazilians believe their Government are, not whether the Government is really effective or not. **Perception** here is the crucial word, so let's keep that in mind. \n\nAlso, the six variables are measured on a scale from -2.5 to 2.5.
