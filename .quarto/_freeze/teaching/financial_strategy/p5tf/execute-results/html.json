This phenomenon, in which individuals imitate each other’s actions, is referred to as disposition effect. \n\n9 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The idea that investors can tailor their risk exposures based on common risk factors has become  known amongst as a smart beta strategy. \n\n10 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> We call the tendency to hang on to losers and sell winners the herd behavior. \n\n11 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The relative wealth concerns bias suggests that investors care most about the performance of their portfolio relative to that of their peers. \n\n12 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The disposition effect refers to investors' tendency to sell winning investments too early and hold onto losing investments for too long due to their preference for realizing losses. \n\n13 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Herd behavior occurs when investors follow the actions of others rather than relying on their own analysis, often leading to market bubbles and crashes. \n\n14 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The disposition effect suggests that investors are more likely to sell losing investments too early and hold onto winning investments for too long, driven by a preference for realizing gains. \n\n15 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> In an efficient market, asset prices fully reflect all available information, making it impossible for investors to consistently outperform the market. \n\n16 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Weak form market efficiency implies that past prices and trading volumes cannot be used to predict future price movements, as they are already reflected in\n  current prices. \n\n17 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> In a semi-strong form efficient market, prices reflect all public information as well as private information known only to a select group of investors. \n\n18 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Strong form market efficiency suggests that even insider information cannot be used to consistently achieve abnormal returns, as it is already reflected in asset prices. \n\n19 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Market efficiency suggests that it is difficult for investors to consistently identify undervalued or overvalued securities through fundamental or technical analysis. \n\n20 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> In a perfectly efficient market, prices reflect all information instantaneously, leaving very limited room for arbitrage opportunities. \n\n21 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If investors have relative wealth concerns, they care most about their  current portfolio performance relative to their past portfolio performance. \n\n22 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Strong-form efficiency implies that professional investors cannot consistently outperform the market. \n\n23 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Semi strong-form efficiency implies that professional investors may outperform the market if they acquire private information  prior to the market. \n\n24 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Semi strong-form efficiency implies that stock prices reflect all available information. \n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n___\n\n**And here are some additional multiple choice
