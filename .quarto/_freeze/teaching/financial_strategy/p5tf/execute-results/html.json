This phenomenon, in which individuals imitate each other’s actions, is referred to as disposition effect. \n\n9 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The idea that investors can tailor their risk exposures based on common risk factors has become  known amongst as a smart beta strategy. \n\n10 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> We call the tendency to hang on to losers and sell winners the herd behavior. \n\n11 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The relative wealth concerns bias suggests that investors care most about the performance of their portfolio relative to that of their peers. \n\n12 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The disposition effect refers to investors' tendency to sell winning investments too early and hold onto losing investments for too long due to their preference for realizing losses. \n\n13 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Herd behavior occurs when investors follow the actions of others rather than relying on their own analysis, often leading to market bubbles and crashes. \n\n14 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The disposition effect suggests that investors are more likely to sell losing investments too early and hold onto winning investments for too long, driven by a preference for realizing gains. \n\n15 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> In an efficient market, asset prices fully reflect all available information, making it impossible for investors to consistently outperform the market. \n\n16 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Weak form market efficiency implies that past prices and trading volumes cannot be used to predict future price movements, as they are already reflected in\n  current prices. \n\n17 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> In a semi-strong form efficient market, prices reflect all public information as well as private information known only to a select group of investors. \n\n18 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Strong form market efficiency suggests that even insider information cannot be used to consistently achieve abnormal returns, as it is already reflected in asset prices. \n\n19 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Market efficiency suggests that it is difficult for investors to consistently identify undervalued or overvalued securities through fundamental or technical analysis. \n\n20 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> In a perfectly efficient market, prices reflect all information instantaneously, leaving very limited room for arbitrage opportunities. \n\n21 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If investors have relative wealth concerns, they care most about their  current portfolio performance relative to their past portfolio performance. \n\n22 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Strong-form efficiency implies that professional investors cannot consistently outperform the market. \n\n23 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Semi strong-form efficiency implies that professional investors may outperform the market if they acquire private information  prior to the market. \n\n24 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Semi strong-form efficiency implies that stock prices reflect all available information. \n\n25 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If the CAPM holds, the expected return of a security is determined solely by its beta relative to the market portfolio. \n\n26 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> According to the CAPM, investors can achieve better returns without increasing risk by selecting stocks with lower betas. \n\n27 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> A zero-beta security is expected to earn the risk-free rate in an efficient market. \n\n28 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> If a stock has a positive alpha, it suggests that the stock is offering a return \nhigher than predicted by its risk level under the CAPM. \n\n29 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> According to the CAPM, an investor’s optimal portfolio should always include only high-beta stocks. \n\n30 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Anomalies, such as the momentum effect, suggest that the CAPM may not fully explain stock returns. \n\n31 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Under the CAPM, investors who are more risk-averse will hold only risk-free assets. \n\n32 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The small-firm effect states that large-cap stocks consistently outperform small-cap stocks after adjusting for risk. \n\n33 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Overconfidence bias can lead investors to trade more frequently than is optimal, often reducing their overall returns. \n\n34 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> If markets are efficient, it is difficult for actively managed mutual funds to consistently outperform passive index funds after fees. \n\n35 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Herding behavior in financial markets often leads to a reduction in price volatility. \n\n36 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Investors suffering from the disposition effect tend to sell winning stocks too quickly while holding onto losing stocks for too long. \n\n37 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> In an efficient market, arbitrage opportunities persist for long periods before being corrected. \n\n38 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Liquidity risk can cause deviations from market efficiency, as investors demand a premium for holding less liquid assets. \n\n39 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The CAPM predicts that stocks with higher idiosyncratic risk should have higher expected returns. \n\n40 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Rational expectations suggest that investors will correctly incorporate all available information into their asset pricing decisions. \n\n41 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A major critique of the CAPM is that it accounts for multiple sources of systematic risk beyond market risk. \n\n42 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Market anomalies challenge the validity of the efficient market hypothesis and suggest potential mispricing. \n\n43 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The Fama-French three-factor model extends the CAPM by including size and value factors in addition to market risk. \n\n44 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> According to the CAPM, stocks with negative betas should have higher expected returns than the risk-free rate. \n\n45 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A stock’s alpha measures its total risk rather than its risk-adjusted return relative to the market. \n\n46 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Momentum investing is based on the observation that stocks that have performed well in the past tend to continue performing well in the near future. \n\n47 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> If market efficiency holds, then insider trading should not yield consistent excess returns over time. \n\n48 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The risk-free rate in the CAPM is typically the expected return of the overall stock market. \n\n49 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The equity risk premium represents the additional return investors require for holding risky stocks over risk-free assets. \n\n50 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) suggests that multiple risk factors beyond market beta can influence asset returns. \n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n___\n\n**And here are some additional multiple choice problems.**\n\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n\n **Q1: Which of the following
