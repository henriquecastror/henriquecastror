According to the CAPM, the market portfolio is efficient. \n\n6 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If we regress a stock’s excess returns against the market’s excess returns, the intercept is the stock’s beta. \n\n7 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> To implement the CAPM, we must (a) construct the market portfolio, and determine its expected excess return over the risk-free interest rate, and (b) estimate the stock’s beta, or sensitivity to the market portfolio. \n\n8 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Beta corresponds to the slope of the best fitting line in the plot of a security’s excess returns versus the market’s standard deviation. \n\n9 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Firm or industry asset betas reflect the market risk of the average project in that firm or industry while individual projects may be more or less sensitive to the overall market. \n\n10 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the discount rate used in capital budgeting to calculate the present value of cash flows arising from a project. \n\n11 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> An increase in a project’s systematic risk will lead to an increase in its required rate of return according to the CAPM. \n\n12 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A firm's beta is independent of its capital structure. \n\n13 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of debt is the effective rate that a company pays on its borrowed funds, including interest and other fees. \n\n14 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of debt is always higher than the cost of equity for a company. \n\n15 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of debt can be calculated using the yield to maturity (YTM) on the company's existing debt. \n\n16 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of debt is the same for all companies within the same industry regardless of their financial health or creditworthiness. \n\n17 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of equity is the return required by equity investors for their investment in a company. \n\n18 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of equity is solely determined by the company's dividend yield and growth rate. \n\n19 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of debt can be calculated using the yield to maturity (YTM) of the firm’s outstanding bonds. \n\n20 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of debt and the interest rate on new loans are always the same. \n\n21 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> When calculating the cost of debt, we must adjust for taxes because interest expenses are tax-deductible. \n\n22 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of equity is always lower than the cost of debt because equity holders have a residual claim on assets. \n\n23 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a common method used to estimate the cost of equity. \n\n24 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The risk-free rate in the CAPM is usually the expected return of the stock market. \n\n25 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Beta measures the systematic risk of a stock relative to the overall market. \n\n26 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The equity risk premium (ERP) is the additional return investors require for holding risky stocks over risk-free securities. \n\n27 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A company's historical return on equity (ROE) is the best estimate of its cost of equity. \n\n28 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) incorporates both the cost of debt and the cost of equity. \n\n29 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If a company has no debt, its WACC is equal to its cost of debt. \n\n30 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of debt should reflect the current market rate at which the company can issue new debt. \n\n31 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Companies should always use book values instead of market values when calculating WACC. \n\n32 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The yield to maturity (YTM) of a bond represents the annualized return an investor will earn if they hold the bond until maturity. \n\n33 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> If the risk-free rate increases, the cost of equity calculated using the CAPM will also increase. \n\n34 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> A decrease in a firm’s beta will generally lower its cost of equity according to the CAPM. \n\n35 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Companies with a high beta have a lower cost of equity under the CAPM model. \n\n36 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of debt is not affected by changes in market interest rates. \n\n37

class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reflects the required return on the firm’s total capital. \n\n39 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> WACC can be used as the discount rate for evaluating new investment projects if the project has similar risk to the firm’s overall business. \n\n40 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A company’s cost of capital is independent of market conditions. \n\n41 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> For firms with no publicly traded stock, the cost of equity can be estimated using industry betas and comparable firms. \n\n42 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Asset beta measures the systematic risk of a firm’s assets and is independent of the firm’s capital structure. \n\n43 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Debt beta is always zero because debt holders do not bear systematic risk. \n\n44 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> A firm’s equity beta is generally higher than its asset beta due to financial leverage. \n\n45 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The asset beta of a leveraged firm is higher than the asset beta of an identical unleveraged firm. \n\n\n:::\n\n\n___\n\n**And here are some additional multiple choice
