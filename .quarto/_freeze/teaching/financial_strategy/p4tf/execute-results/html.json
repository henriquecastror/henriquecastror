According to the CAPM, the market portfolio is efficient. \n\n6 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If we regress a stock’s excess returns against the market’s excess returns, the intercept is the stock’s beta. \n\n7 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> To implement the CAPM, we must (a) construct the market portfolio, and determine its expected excess return over the risk-free interest rate, and (b) estimate the stock’s beta, or sensitivity to the market portfolio. \n\n8 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Beta corresponds to the slope of the best fitting line in the plot of a security’s excess returns versus the market’s standard deviation. \n\n9 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Firm or industry asset betas reflect the market risk of the average project in that firm or industry while individual projects may be more or less sensitive to the overall market. \n\n10 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the discount rate used in capital budgeting to calculate the present value of cash flows arising from a project. \n\n11 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> An increase in a project’s systematic risk will lead to an increase in its required rate of return according to the CAPM. \n\n12 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A firm's beta is independent of its capital structure. \n\n13 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of debt is the effective rate that a company pays on its borrowed funds, including interest and other fees. \n\n14 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of debt is always higher than the cost of equity for a company. \n\n15 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of debt can be calculated using the yield to maturity (YTM) on the company's existing debt. \n\n16 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of debt is the same for all companies within the same industry regardless of their financial health or creditworthiness. \n\n17 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The cost of equity is the return required by equity investors for their investment in a company. \n\n18 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The cost of equity is solely determined by the company's dividend yield and growth rate. \n\n\n:::\n\n\n___\n\n<script src=\"https://giscus.app/client.js\"\n        data-repo=\"henriquecastror/EF_permanent\"\n        data-repo-id=\"R_kgDOLMIejg\"\n        data-category=\"General\"\n        data-category-id=\"DIC_kwDOLMIejs4Cc1yS\"\n        data-mapping=\"number\"\n        data-term=\"7\"\n        data-reactions-enabled=\"1\"\n        data-emit-metadata=\"0\"\n        data-input-position=\"bottom\"\n        data-theme=\"light\"\n        data-lang=\"en\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n\n",
