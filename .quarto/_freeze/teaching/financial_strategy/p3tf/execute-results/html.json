The volatility of a large portfolio results from the common risk between the stocks in the portfolio. \n\n4 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Short selling extends the set of possible portfolios. \n\n5 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> Investors mainly worry about those risks that can be eliminated through diversification. \n\n6 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Efficient portfolios offer investors the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk. \n\n7 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> To find the risk of a portfolio, we need to know the degree to which stock returns move together. Covariance and correlation measure the co-movement of returns. \n\n8 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The goal of an investor who is seeking to earn the highest possible expected return for any level  of volatility is to find the portfolio that generates the steepest possible line when combined with the risk-free investment. \n\n9 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Under the CAPM assumptions, the capital market line (CML), which is the set of portfolios obtained by combining the risk-free

portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. \n\n16 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated by dividing the excess return of an investment by its standard deviation. \n\n17 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The Capital Market Line (CML) represents the risk-return tradeoff for efficient portfolios that combine the risk-free asset with the market portfolio. \n\n18 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> A well-diversified portfolio always consists of assets with low or negative correlations to each other to reduce overall portfolio risk. \n\n19 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The Markowitz Efficient Set refers to the collection of portfolios that offer the maximum expected return for any given level of portfolio risk, based on Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory. \n\n20 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> An asset's standard deviation represents its systematic risk in the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). \n\n21 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> An efficient portfolio has no risk at all. \n\n22 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The presence of a risk-free asset enables the investor to borrow or lend at the risk-free rate and form portfolios having greater Sharpe ratios. \n\n23 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The security market line (SML) is the graph of expected rate of return on investment vs. the variance of returns. \n\n24 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> If a stock is overpriced, it would plot above the security market line. \n\n25 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> A stock's alpha is the difference between the expected return and the required return according to the CAPM. \n\n26 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> Adding assets with low or negative correlations to a portfolio generally reduces overall risk. \n\n27 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> In equilibrium, it is possible to earn a return that is above the efficient frontier without the existence of a risk-free asset or some other asset that is uncorrelated with your portfolio assets. \n\n28 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of risk. \n\n29 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> A stock's alpha reflects its performance relative to a benchmark index after adjusting for market risk. \n\n30 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"T\"]'/> A stock with a beta of 0 is expected to have no correlation with market movements. \n\n31 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"F\"]'/> The risk-free asset has a beta of 1. \n\n32 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase'
