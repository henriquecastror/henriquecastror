Had the sun not been out that day, the victim would have been safe.*\n\n- There is a correlation, but it is clear there is no causation.\n\n. . . \n\nSometimes, there is causality even when we do not observe correlation.\n\n*The sailor is adjusting the rudder on a windy day to align the boat with the wind, but the boat is not changing direction.* ([Source: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/01-introduction#do-not-confuse-correlation-with-causality))\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n**In this example, the sailor is *endogenously* adjusting the course to balance the unobserved wind.**\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The challenge  {.smaller }\n\n- I will discuss some issues in using plain OLS models in Finance Research (mainly with panel data).\n\n. . .\n\n- I will avoid the word ‚Äúendogeneity‚Äù as much as possible.\n\n  - This word refers to the violation of the Conditional Mean Independence (CMI) assumption, meaning that $x$ and $\\mu$ are correlated.\n\n. . .\n\n- I will also avoid the word ‚Äúidentification‚Äù because identification does not guarantee causality and vice-versa (Kahn and Whited 2017)\n\n. . .\n\n- The discussion is mainly based on [Atanasov and Black (2016)](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/CFR-0036)\n\n![](slides1-empiricalissues-paper.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The challenge  {.smaller }\n\n- Imagine that you want to investigate the effect of Governance on Q\n\n    - You may have more covariates explaining Q (omitted  from slides)\n  \n $ùë∏_{i} = Œ± + ùú∑_{i} √ó Gov + Controls + error$\n\n. . . \n\n All the issues in the next slides will make it not possible to infer that __changing Gov will _CAUSE_ a change in Q__ \n \n That is, cannot infer causality\n \n![](slides1-empiricalissues-wrong.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 1) Reverse causation   {.smaller }\n\n- Perhaps it is $Q$ that causes $Gov$\n\n- OLS based methods do not tell the difference between these two betas:\n\n    - $Q_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta √ó Gov_{i} + Controls + \\epsilon$\n\n    - $Gov_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta √ó Q_{i} + Controls + \\epsilon$\n\n- If one Beta is significant, the other will most likely be significant too\n\n- You need a sound theory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 2) Simultaneity  {.smaller }\n\n- Perhaps $Gov$ and $Q$ are determined simultaneously\n\n- That is, there is a third variable causing both\n\n- An OLS regression will provide a biased estimate of the effect\n\n- Also, the sign might be wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 3) Omitted variable bias (OVB)  {.smaller }\n\n- Imagine that you do not include an important ‚Äútrue‚Äù predictor of $Q$\n\n- Let's say, long is:  $ùë∏_{i} = \\alpha_{long} + \\beta_{long}* gov_{i} + Œ¥ * omitted + error$\n\n- But you estimate short:  $ùë∏_{i} = \\alpha_{short} + \\beta_{short}* gov_{i} + error$\n\n- $\\beta_{short}$ will be: \n\n    - $\\beta_{short} = \\beta_{long}$ +  bias\n\n    - $\\beta_{short} = \\beta_{long}$ +  relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) * effect of omitted in long (Œ¥)\n\n        - Where: relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) is: $Omitted = \\alpha + œï *Gov_{i} + \\mu$\n\n- Thus, OVB is: $\\beta_{short} ‚Äì \\beta_{long} = œï * Œ¥$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 4) Bad Controls {.smaller }\n\n- **Bad controls** are variables that are **also outcome of the treatment** (i.e., $Gov$) being studied.\n\n- A **Bad control** could very well be a **dependent variable** of $Gov$ as well. \n\n- **Good controls** are variables that **you can think as being fixed** at the time of the treatment. \n\n    - $ùëÑ_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta √ó Gov_{i} + Controls + \\epsilon$\n\n- Assuming you also have something that is the consequence of good governance (e.g., Novo Mercado dummy). Should you include it in the model?\n\n- No. In this case, the coefficient of interest no longer has a causal interpretation.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n**It is not hard to come up with stories of why a control is a bad control.**\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## OVB &  Bad Controls {.smaller }\n\n![](confounding variables.png) \n\n\n\n\n## 5) Collider bias {.smaller }\n\nCollider bias occurs when an independent variable and outcome each influence a common third variable and that variable or collider is controlled for in the regression.\n\n    - In a way, a collider is a bad control. \n    - While a bad control makes you underestimate the coefficient, a collider creates spurious correlation between the X and the Y.\n    \nIn the analysis below\n\n    - $Q_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta √ó Gov_{i} + Controls + \\epsilon$\n    \nIncluding, for instance, CEO Reputation (assuming that both $Q$ and $Gov$ influences Reputation) creates a false correlation between $Qov$ and $Q$.\n\n    - You may estimate a positive association even when there is none.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n## 6) Specification error  {.smaller }\n\n- Even if we could perfectly measure $Gov$ and all relevant covariates, we would not know for sure the functional form through which each influences $Q$.\n\n    - Functional form: linear? Quadratic? Log-log? Semi-log?\n\n- Misspecification of x‚Äôs is similar to OVB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 7) Signaling   {.smaller }\n\n- Perhaps, some individuals are signaling the existence of an X without truly having it:\n\n    - For instance: firms signaling they have good governance without having it\n\n- This is similar to the OVB because you cannot observe the full story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 8) Construct validity  {.smaller }\n\n- Some constructs (e.g. $Gov$) are complex, and sometimes have conflicting mechanisms\n\n- We usually don‚Äôt know for sure what ‚Äúgood‚Äù governance is, for instance\n\n- It is common to use imperfect proxies, that may poorly fit the underlying concept\n\n\n![](proxy variable.png) \n\n\n\n\n\n## 9) Heterogeneous effects  {.smaller }\n\n- Maybe the causal effect of $Gov$ on $Q$ depends on observed and unobserved firm characteristics:\n\n    - Let's assume that firms seek to maximize $Q$\n    - Different firms have different optimal $Gov$\n    - Firms know their optimal $Gov$\n    - If we observed all factors that affect $Q$, each firm would be at its own optimum and OLS regression would give a non-significant coefficient\n\n- In such case, we may find a positive or negative relationship\n\n- Neither is the true causal relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 10) Measurement error   {.smaller }\n\n- \"Classical\" random measurement error in x‚Äôs will bias  **coefficient toward zero**\n\n    - $x^{*} = x + \\sigma_{2}$\n    - Imagine that $x^{*}$ is a bunch of noise. It would not explain anything\n    - Thus, your results are biased toward zero\n    \n- \"Classical\" random measurement error for the outcome will inflate standard errors but **will not lead to biased coefficients.** \n\n    - $y^{*} = y + \\sigma_{1}$\n    - If you estimante $y^{*} = f(x)$, you have $y + \\sigma_{1} = x + \\epsilon$ \n    - $y = x + u$ \n        - where $u = \\epsilon + \\sigma_{1}$ \n\n\n<!-- https://web.stanford.edu/class/polisci100a/regress5.pdf  --> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 11) Observation bias   {.smaller }\n\n- This is analogous to the Hawthorne effect, in which observed subjects behave differently because they are observed\n\n- Firms which change gov may behave differently because their managers or employees think the change in $Gov$ matters, when in fact it has no direct effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 12) Interdependent effects {.smaller }\n\n- Imagine that a governance reform that will not affect share prices for a single firm might be effective if several firms adopt because investors will appreciate the reform‚Äôs impact.\n\n- Conversely, a reform that improves efficiency for a single firm might not improve its $Q$ if adopted widely because the gains will be competed away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 13) Selection bias   {.smaller }\n\n- If you run a regression with two types of companies\n\n    - High gov (let's say they are the treated group)\n    - Low gov (let's say they are the control group)\n\n- Without any matching method, these companies are likely not comparable\n\n    - *Apples compared to oranges*\n    \n- Thus, the estimated beta will contain selection bias, which can be **either be positive or negative**\n\n\n  \n\n## 14) Self-Selection {.smaller }\n\n- Self-selection is a type of selection bias. Usually, firms decide which level of governance they adopt\n\n- It is like they \"self-select\" into the treatment.\n\n    - Units decide whether they receive the treatment or not\n    \n- There are reasons why firms adopt high governance\n\n    - If observable, you need to control for. If unobservable, you have a problem.\n\n![](selection bias.png) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  {.smaller }\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n**More data is not necessarily a solution, you need a sound empirical design.**\n\n:::\n\n\n\n![](hypothesis2.png) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **THANK YOU!** {background=\"#b1cafa\"}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n**QUESTIONS?**\n\n![](qa2.png){width=\"150%\" heigth=\"150%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**Henrique C.
