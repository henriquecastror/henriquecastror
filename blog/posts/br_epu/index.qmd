In this post, I will show how to create a graph about the Brazilian Economic Policy Uncertainty index. For more information about this index, click [here](https://www.policyuncertainty.com/). Shortly, it is an index that calculates economic policy uncertainty by searching for specific words in Brazilian newspapers.


Let's download the data and create a graph to see what happens.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(httr)
library(zoo)
url1<-'https://www.policyuncertainty.com/media/Brazil_Policy_Uncertainty_Data.xlsx'
GET(url1, write_disk(tf <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))
data <- read_excel(tf)
colnames(data) <- c("Year", "Month", "EPU")
data<- data[1:nrow(data)-1,]
data$date <- as.yearmon(paste(data$Year, data$Month), "%Y %m")

data <-subset(data, Year >= 2010)

```




Finally, let's create a graph:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data= data, aes(x=date, y =EPU ) ) + geom_line() + theme_solarized() +
  labs(title = "Brazil Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) (since 2010)",
       caption = "Source: https://www.policyuncertainty.com/") 
```


Well, it seems that we do not have too much uncertainty at the moment. At least not the type of uncertainty that this index measures. Still, this is a nice index to learn more about.

Thanks for stopping by!
