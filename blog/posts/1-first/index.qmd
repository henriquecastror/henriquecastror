I started using [Quarto](quarto.org) very recently. This is a post to remember some things I want to remember in the future.

## Callout Basics

-   note
-   tip
-   important
-   caution
-   warning

``` markdown
:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
