# Synthetic Control {.smaller background="#f2c7c4"}

## Synthetic Control {.smaller background="#f2c7c4"}

It is a method to estimate the effect of events or policy interventions, often at an **aggregate level** (cities, states, etc.)

The event occurs often in **only one unit**.

It compares the evolution of the  outcome for the treated unit to the evolution of the control group.

- The control group contains many units. 

. . . 

The limitation is often the selection of the control group. It is very **ambiguous**.






## Synthetic Control {.smaller background="#f2c7c4"}

[Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746) apply synth  by using a cigarette tax in California called Proposition 99.

*In 1988, California passed comprehensive tobacco control legislation called Proposition 99.*

*Proposition 99 increased cigarette taxes by $0.25 a pack, spurred clean-air ordinances throughout the state, funded anti-smoking media campaigns, earmarked tax revenues to health and anti-smoking budgets, and produced more than $100 million a year in anti-tobacco projects.*

*Other states had similar control programs, and they were dropped from their analysis.* [Mastering Metrics](https://mixtape.scunning.com/10-synthetic_control#cuba-miami-and-the-mariel-boatlift)

There was a trend before the treatment. **How can we estimate the causal effect?**

## Synthetic Control {.smaller background="#f2c7c4"}

The goal is to  elect an optimal set of weights that when applied to the rest of the country produces the following figure: 

![](figs/synth3.png)


## Synthetic Control {.smaller background="#f2c7c4"}

The variables used for computing the weights are the following. You are creating weights such that weighting the other states, you can create a synthetic California. **Notice that, so far, the product of this analysis is only two data points per period.**

**Tip**: Synth is also an graphical method, so graphs like the following are common. This is the difference between the two series.

**Notice that, so far, the product of this analysis is only two data points per period.** How can you stablish a "significant" causal effect?


**Steps**

1) Apply synth to each state in the control group (also called "donor pool"). 

2) Obtain a distribution of placebos.

3) Compare the gap for California to the distribution of the placebo gaps.

4) Then, test whether the effect for the treated unit is large enough relative to the placebos (i.e., to the effect estimated for a placebo unit randomly selected).







## Inference {.smaller background="#d49692"}

Notice the bold line (treated unit) after the treatment. It is at the bottom.

## Inference {.smaller background="#d49692"}

*Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) recommend iteratively dropping the states whose pre-treatment RMSPE is considerably different than California‚Äôs because as you can see, they‚Äôre kind of blowing up the scale and making it hard to see what‚Äôs going on.* [Mastering Metrics](https://mixtape.scunning.com/10-synthetic_control#cuba-miami-and-the-mariel-boatlift)

![](figs/synth6.png)






## Inference {.smaller background="#d49692"}

The previous figure suggests the effect is large enough relative to the placebo effects.

. . . 


1) The root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) is:

$$RMSPE = \bigg (\dfrac{1}{T-T_0} \sum_{t=T_0+t}^T \bigg (Y_{1t} - \sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_j^* Y_{jt} \bigg )^2 \bigg )^{\tfrac{1}{2}}$$

*It shows how far predictions fall from measured true values using Euclidean distance.*



2) Sort the ratio post- to pre-treatment RMSPE in descending order

3) Calculate the p-value as $\frac{Rank}{Total}$.


. . . 

Basically, these steps give how likely is the occurrence of the treated unit distance vis-a-vis the average placebo.











## Inference {.smaller background="#d49692"}

**RMSPE**: in the previous example, California has the largest increase in the error after the treatment. Position 1 out of 39 states, implying an exact p-value of $\frac{1}{38}=0.026$ (significant).

*Authors using synthetic control must do more than merely run the synth command when doing comparative case studies.* 

*They must find the exact-values through placebo-based inference, check for the quality of the pre-treatment fit, investigate the balance of the covariates used for matching, and check for the validity of the model through placebo estimation (e.g., rolling back the treatment date).*
