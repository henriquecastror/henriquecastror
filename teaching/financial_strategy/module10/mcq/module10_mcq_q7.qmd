âœ… A is correct. In Brazil, dividends distributed by domestic corporations are generally exempt from personal income tax for resident individuals, while capital gains are taxed and interest on equity (JCP) is subject to withholding tax. This can make dividends relatively more attractive than share repurchases for local investors.
