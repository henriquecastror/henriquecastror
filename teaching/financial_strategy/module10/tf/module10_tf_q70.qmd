  <label for="module10_tf_q70"><strong>Retaining excess cash within the firm is always tax-efficient because corporate investment income is not subject to additional taxation.</strong></label>

<div id="feedback-module10_tf_q70" class="feedback" data-status="" style="display:none;">
FALSE. Retaining cash can create a tax disadvantage since the firm pays corporate taxes on investment income and shareholders later pay capital gains taxes when the cash is eventually distributed. This double layer of taxation can make retention less efficient than immediate payout.
