## Core Concepts

### 1. Equity for Private Companies

Private firms often rely on angel investors or venture capital (VC) to grow. Angels invest early using SAFEs or convertible notes. VCs raise capital from institutions, offer expertise, and demand strong control. Private equity targets mature firms via leveraged buyouts. Corporate and institutional investors bring strategic goals or diversification.

### 2. Raising Capital: From VC to IPO

Startups issue preferred stock—convertible, no dividends, senior in liquidation. Each funding round (e.g., Series A) sets new terms. Valuation is split into **pre-money** (before investment) and **post-money** (after). Founders are diluted over time.

An **IPO** provides liquidity and new capital but demands transparency. Underwriters manage the offering, price via **book building**, and charge fees (~7%). IPOs tend to be underpriced and cyclical; long-term performance is mixed.

### 3. Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEO)

Public firms may issue equity again via SEOs. In a **cash offer**, new shares are sold broadly. In a **rights offer**, only current shareholders may buy. Rights offers prevent dilution. SEOs can trigger negative price reactions and still carry costs (~5%).
