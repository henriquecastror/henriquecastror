p1 <- rnorm(1, mean = 10, sd = 2)
p2 <- rnorm(1, mean = 10, sd = 2)
div <- rnorm(1, mean = 1, sd = 0.1)
```

**Q:** You bought a stock one year ago for `r round(p1,3)` per share and sold it today for `r round(p2,3)`. It paid a `r round(div,3)` per share dividend today.

What was your realized return?

`r fitb( round( (p2-p1+div)/p1 * 100 ,3) , tol=0.001)`

How much of the return came from dividend yield and how much came from capital gain?

- Dividend Yield: `r fitb(round( (div)/p1 * 100 ,3) , tol=0.001)`

- Capital gain: `r fitb(round( (p2-p1)/p1 * 100 ,3) , tol=0.001)`

**Answer**:

1) `r  round( (p2-p1+div)/p1 * 100 ,3) `

2) `r round( (div)/p1 * 100 ,3) `

3) `r round( (p2-p1)/p1 * 100 ,3) `
