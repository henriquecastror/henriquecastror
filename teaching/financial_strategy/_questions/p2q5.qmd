mrp <- rnorm(1, mean = 8, sd = 0.01)
rf <- rnorm(1, mean = 5, sd = 0.01)
beta <- rnorm(1, mean = 0.9, sd = 0.2)
```

**Q:** Suppose the market risk premium is `r round(mrp,3)` and the risk-free interest rate is `r round(rf,3)`. Calculate the cost of capital of investing in a project with a beta of `r round(beta,3)`? 

`r fitb( round(rf + beta * mrp ,3) , tol=0.001)`
