An investor builds a portfolio with 50% in Asset A (σ=18%) and 50% in Asset B (σ=12%). If the correlation between A and B is 0.25, which statement is correct about the portfolio’s risk relative to its components?

<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q69" value="A"> A. The portfolio volatility must equal the simple average: 15%.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q69" value="B"> B. The portfolio volatility is higher than Asset A’s volatility, since A is riskier.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q69" value="C"> C. The portfolio volatility will be lower than both assets’ volatilities, because correlation is less than 1.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q69" value="D"> D. The portfolio volatility lies between 12% and 18%, and is reduced below 15% by diversification due to correlation &lt; 1.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q69" value="E"> E. The portfolio volatility is always equal to the weighted average of component volatilities, regardless of correlation.</label><br>

✅ Correct: D. Portfolio risk is given by  
\(\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_A^2\sigma_A^2 + w_B^2\sigma_B^2 + 2w_Aw_B\sigma_A\sigma_B\rho_{AB}}\).  
With \(w_A=w_B=0.5\), \(\rho_{AB}=0.25\),  
\(\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.25(0.18^2+0.12^2)+0.25(2)(0.18)(0.12)(0.25)} \approx 14.2\%\).  
This is **lower than the weighted average (15%)**, but still between the two individual volatilities (12% and 18%).  
Diversification reduces risk, but cannot push it below the least risky asset unless correlation is negative.
