<strong style="display: block;">
An investor constructs a two-asset portfolio with equal weights in Asset A and Asset B. 
Asset A has a volatility (σA) of 10%, while Asset B has a volatility (σB) of 20%. 
The correlation between the two assets’ returns is zero, meaning they are uncorrelated. 
Using portfolio theory, what is the resulting volatility of the portfolio, and what does this outcome imply about the benefits of diversification?

✅ Correct: A. The portfolio volatility is σp = √[(0.5² × 0.1²) + (0.5² × 0.2²)] = 0.1118 = 11.18%. 
Because the assets are uncorrelated, the portfolio risk is strictly lower than the weighted average of individual risks, demonstrating the power of diversification in reducing overall volatility.
