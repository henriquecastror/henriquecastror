Over time, the annualized volatility of a broad market index is typically much lower than the weighted-average volatility of its individual constituent stocks. 
However, during episodes of systemic stress, both volatilities rise and the gap between them narrows. 
Which mechanism best explains this pattern?

✅ Correct: C. Outside crises, low cross-stock correlations mean a covariance matrix with small off-diagonal terms, so diversification reduces index variance (Var = w'Σw). In crises, correlations spike, cross terms grow, diversification weakens, and the index’s volatility moves closer to the average individual volatility.
