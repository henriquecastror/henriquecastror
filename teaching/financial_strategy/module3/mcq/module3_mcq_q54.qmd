A stock’s rolling 12-month volatility rose from 15% to 25% over the past year, while its estimated beta remained roughly constant at β = 0.9. 
With risk-free rate rf = 3% and expected market return E(Rm) = 9%, which statement is MOST consistent with CAPM and mean–variance analysis **now**?

✅ Correct: D. In CAPM, required return depends on β, not total volatility. With β constant at 0.9, E(R) stays at 8.4%. 
However, higher total volatility lowers risk-adjusted performance: Sharpe = (E(R) − rf)/σ falls from ≈0.36 to ≈0.22.
