An equity analyst is evaluating a company’s stock using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). 
The stock has a beta of 1.2, reflecting its sensitivity relative to the market portfolio. 
The risk-free rate is currently 3% per year, while the expected market return is 9%. 
Based on CAPM, what is the stock’s expected return, and how should it be interpreted in terms of compensation for bearing systematic risk?

✅ Correct: D. According to CAPM, E(R) = 3% + 1.2 × (9% − 3%) = 10.2%. This means investors require a return above the market average to be compensated for the stock’s higher exposure to systematic (non-diversifiable) risk.
