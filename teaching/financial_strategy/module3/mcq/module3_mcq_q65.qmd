✅ Correct: D. Under CAPM, asset pricing depends only on **systematic risk**.  
Expected return is given by:  
\(E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \times (E(R_m) - R_f)\).  
This shows that only the portion of risk correlated with the market (beta) is priced, while unsystematic risk can be diversified away and is not compensated.
