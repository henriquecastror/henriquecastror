cat("2", fitb("F", num = FALSE, ignore_case = TRUE), "Unlevered beta measures the risk of a company's stock against that of the broader market, including the impact of a company's capital structure and leverage, while levered beta measures the market risk of a company without the impact of debt.",  "\n\n")
