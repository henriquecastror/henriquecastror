  Critics argue that the CAPM is too simplistic.  
  Which of the following best summarizes the empirical evidence that led to multifactor models like the Fama-French three-factor model?
  </strong>

  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q88" value="A"> A. Beta alone perfectly explains the cross-section of stock returns across all industries.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q88" value="B"> B. Market anomalies such as momentum and value premia disappeared once CAPM was widely adopted.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q88" value="C"> C. Evidence showed that small-cap and growth stocks consistently underperformed predictions of CAPM.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q88" value="D"> D. Empirical studies revealed that size and value effects systematically explain returns beyond beta, motivating multifactor models.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q88" value="E"> E. CAPM failed only during recessions, but otherwise holds without anomalies.</label><br>

âœ… Correct: D. CAPM could not account for persistent size and value effects. These anomalies led to the Fama-French three-factor model, which added size and book-to-market factors to beta.
