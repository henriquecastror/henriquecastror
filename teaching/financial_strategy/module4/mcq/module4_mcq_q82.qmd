  A large utility company argues that because its revenues are relatively stable, it should discount all projects at the regulated WACC.  
  However, management is considering investing in renewable ventures with volatile cash flows.  
  What is the conceptual flaw in applying the same WACC indiscriminately?

✅ Correct: C. Applying the corporate WACC assumes projects share the same risk as existing assets. Riskier ventures like renewables require adjusting the discount rate upward.
