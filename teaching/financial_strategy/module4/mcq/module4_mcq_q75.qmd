  An analyst claims that by simply lowering the firm’s beta estimate from 1.4 to 0.8,  
  the company can reduce its cost of equity and improve valuation.  
  What is the main problem with this reasoning?

  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q75" value="A"> A. Beta is irrelevant for the CAPM, so the cost of equity does not change.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q75" value="B"> B. The risk-free rate already captures systematic risk, making beta redundant.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q75" value="C"> C. Changing beta automatically alters the market risk premium in CAPM.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q75" value="D"> D. Beta is determined by the firm’s underlying business and cannot be arbitrarily adjusted to lower the cost of equity.</label><br>

✅ Correct: D. Beta reflects the firm’s exposure to systematic market risk, which is linked to its operations and industry. It cannot be reduced by choice. If a firm operates in a volatile, cyclical sector, its beta — and thus its cost of equity — will remain high regardless of how managers wish to present it.
