<form onsubmit="event.preventDefault(); checkAnswer('module4_mcq_q29')" data-correct-answer="D"> <strong style="display: block;"> The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relies on a set of strong assumptions about investor behavior and market structure. Which of the following best captures one of its most critical assumptions that is often unrealistic in practice? </strong>

<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q29" value="A"> A. Investors differ in their expectations about future returns, but markets aggregate these views efficiently.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q29" value="B"> B. Investors can only hold risky assets and are not allowed to borrow or lend at the risk-free rate.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q29" value="C"> C. The market portfolio may consist of only a subset of risky assets rather than all assets in the economy.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q29" value="D"> D. All investors have homogeneous expectations about returns, volatilities, and correlations, leading them to hold the same efficient market portfolio.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q29" value="E"> E. The CAPM requires investors to prefer risky assets over risk-free assets in order to achieve diversification.</label><br>

</form> <div id="feedback-module4_mcq_q29" class="feedback" data-status="" style="display:none;"> âœ… Correct: D. A central assumption of the CAPM is that all investors share homogeneous expectations, which ensures they identify the same efficient portfolio of risky assets (the market portfolio). In practice, differences in beliefs and constraints make this assumption unrealistic. </div>
