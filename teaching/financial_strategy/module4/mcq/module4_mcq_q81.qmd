  In the context of international capital budgeting, suppose a Brazilian firm is estimating its cost of equity for a project in the U.S.  
  The analyst suggests using the CAPM with the U.S. risk-free rate, the S&P 500 as the market proxy, and a beta estimated from Brazilian peers.  
  Which is the most accurate criticism?

âœ… Correct: D. CAPM requires consistency: if using the U.S. market as the benchmark, the beta must be estimated against that same market, not against Brazilian peers.
