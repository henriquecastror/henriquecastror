  Consider two firms with identical operations, except one holds substantial cash reserves.  
  If analysts compute asset betas without adjusting for cash, what distortion occurs in the estimate of the firm’s business risk?

  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q86" value="A"> A. The asset beta will be inflated because cash raises total firm volatility.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q86" value="B"> B. The asset beta will remain unchanged because cash does not affect leverage.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q86" value="C"> C. The asset beta will be understated, since risk-free cash dilutes the measured exposure to market risk.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q86" value="D"> D. The beta of debt will fully offset the effect of excess cash.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q86" value="E"> E. Cash reserves increase the firm’s correlation with the market, overstating systematic risk.</label><br>

✅ Correct: C. Holding large cash reserves reduces the true risk of the business, but if cash is not netted out, the asset beta appears artificially low because the risk-free portion dilutes the operating risk signal.
