  <strong style="display: block;">A stock is found to have a negative beta (β = –0.2) when regressed against the market. Which interpretation is most consistent with CAPM?</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q68" value="A"> A. The stock carries extremely high total risk, hence negative required return.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q68" value="B"> B. The stock acts as a hedge, tending to move opposite to the market, and thus may have an expected return below the risk-free rate.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q68" value="C"> C. Negative betas are estimation errors and cannot persist in practice.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q68" value="D"> D. The CAPM predicts that such a stock must still earn the market return on average.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q68" value="E"> E. The firm is bankrupt, which explains the negative coefficient.</label><br>

✅ Correct: B. Negative-beta assets are valuable hedges. CAPM predicts they can have expected returns lower than the risk-free rate, reflecting insurance-like properties.
