  <strong style="display: block;">An analyst is estimating the cost of equity using CAPM. She argues that since the firm operates in a very cyclical industry, she should add an extra “cyclicality premium” on top of the CAPM result. Which is the most rigorous criticism of this approach?</strong>

  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="A"> A. It is acceptable, since CAPM ignores macroeconomic cycles.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="B"> B. It is incorrect, because the effect of cyclicality is already embedded in the firm’s beta, which measures sensitivity to market conditions.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="C"> C. It is necessary, because CAPM only accounts for idiosyncratic risk, not systematic cyclicality.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="D"> D. It is optional, as CAPM can be adjusted with any additional premiums the analyst considers relevant.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="E"> E. It depends on whether the firm’s competitors also adjust their CAPM estimates.</label><br>

✅ Correct: B. In CAPM, the beta coefficient already captures the degree to which a firm’s cash flows are affected by cyclical market fluctuations. Adding an arbitrary “cyclicality premium” would double-count the same risk, leading to an overestimation of the cost of equity.
