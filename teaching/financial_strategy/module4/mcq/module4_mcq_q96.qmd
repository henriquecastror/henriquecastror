  Why might empirical tests of the CAPM often find that low-beta stocks earn higher returns than predicted, while high-beta stocks earn lower returns?
  </strong>

  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="A"> A. Because the CAPM systematically underestimates idiosyncratic risk premiums.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="B"> B. Because the equity risk premium is mismeasured and often negative in practice.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="C"> C. Because leverage and borrowing constraints push investors toward high-beta stocks, depressing their returns relative to low-beta stocks.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="D"> D. Because low-beta stocks are always more illiquid and must compensate with higher returns.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module4_mcq_q96" value="E"> E. Because estimation errors in beta necessarily reverse the CAPM predictions.</label><br>

âœ… Correct: C. Evidence suggests that leverage constraints lead investors to bid up high-beta stocks, lowering their realized returns, while low-beta stocks deliver higher returns than predicted.
