  A utility company argues that because its revenues are very stable,  
  it can apply the same corporate WACC to evaluate all new investments,  
  including ventures in renewable energy that have much higher cash flow volatility.  
  What is the flaw in this reasoning?

✅ Correct: C. The appropriate discount rate depends on the project’s risk. Using the corporate WACC for all projects ignores differences in project betas. A renewable venture with higher systematic risk should be discounted at a higher rate than a stable utility project, otherwise the firm risks accepting value-destroying investments.
