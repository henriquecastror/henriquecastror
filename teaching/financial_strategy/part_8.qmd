# 15.1 The Interest Tax Deduction {.smaller background="#eeffef"}

## 15.1 The Interest Tax Deduction {.smaller background="#eeffef"}

Corporations pay taxes on their profits after interest payments are deducted.

-   Thus, **interest expense reduces the amount of corporate taxes**.
-   This creates an **incentive to use debt**.


|                   | With Leverage | Without Leverage |
|-------------------|--------|--------|
| EBIT              | 2800   | 2800   |
| Interest Expense  | -400   | 0      |
| Income before tax | 2400   | 2800   |
| Taxes (35%)       | -840   | -980   |
| Net income        | 1560   | 1820   |


. . .

**(All) Investors receive 1560 + 400 (with leverage) vs. 1820 + 0 (without leverage)**.

The takeaway: in the presence of taxes, leverage increases firm value (equity value + debt value) **because the total cash flow received by investors increases**.






## 15.1 The Interest Tax Deduction {.smaller background="#eeffef"}

**By how much the firm value increases?**

- The value is created because the firm pays less taxes.

$$980 - 840 = 140$$

. . .

We can manage to find the same number, as follows:

$$Interest\; Tax\; Shield = Corporate \;Tax \;Rate \times Interest \;Payments = $$ 
$$35\% \times 400 \;million= 140\;million$$






## 15.1 The Interest Tax Deduction {.smaller background="#eeffef"}

**Problem**

- For the most recent fiscal year, Texasfield had **5.35 million in interest expense**.
- If the firm’s **marginal tax rate is 30%**, what is the value of the **interest tax shield** for Texasfield in the most recent fiscal year?

. . .

**Solution**

$$5.35 \times 30\% = 1.61\;million$$














# 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

When a firm uses debt, **the interest tax shield provides a corporate tax benefit each year.**

- It is like the firm *"receives"* an extra cash flow each year.

This benefit is then computed as the **present value of the stream of future interest tax shields** the firm will receive.

$$CFs\;to\;investors\;(lev) =  CFs\;to\;investors\;(no\;lev) + Interest\;tax\;shield$$

## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

![](figs/bm_15_1.png)






## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**MM Proposition I with Taxes**

**The total value of the levered firm exceeds the value of the firm without leverage due to the present value of the tax savings from debt:**

$$V^L = V^U + PV(interests\;tax\;shield)$$





## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**Problem**

- Suppose ALCO plans to pay **60 million** in interest each year for the next eight years, and then repay the principal of **1 billion** in year 8.

- These payments are risk free, and ALCO’s marginal tax rate will remain **39%** throughout this period. 

- If the risk-free interest rate is **6%**, by **how much does the interest tax shield increase the value of ALCO**?

. . .

**Solution**

Annual interest tax shield is:

$$1 \;billion \times 6\% \times 39\% = 23.4 \;million \;(for\;eigth\;years)$$

$$PV(Interest\;tax\;shield) = \frac{23,4}{(1+0,06)^1} + . . . + \frac{23,4}{(1+0,06)^8} = 145.31 \;million$$


## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**The Interest Tax Shield with Permanent Debt**: Typically, the level of future interest payments is uncertain due to:

::: {.incremental}
- changes in the marginal tax rate, 
- the amount of debt outstanding, 
- the interest rate on that debt, 
- and the risk of the firm.
- others
:::

. . .

For simplicity, **we will consider the special case in which the above variables are kept constant**. This is reasonable because:

- many corporations have policies for fixed amounts of debt
- as old bonds and loans mature, new borrowing takes place
- debt can be assumed as **permanent**, because it is fixed through time








## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

Suppose a firm borrows debt D and keeps the debt permanently. 

If the firm’s marginal tax rate is $\tau_c$, and if the debt is riskless with a risk-free interest rate $r_f$, then the interest tax shield each year is $\tau_c \times r_f \times D$, and the tax shield can be valued as a perpetuity:



$$PV(interest\;tax\;shield) = \frac{\tau_c \times Interest}{r_f} = \frac{\tau_c \times (R_f \times D)}{r_f} = \tau_c \times D$$

Given a 21% corporate tax rate, this equation implies that for every 1 in new permanent debt that the firm issues, the value of the firm increases by 0.21.

. . .

Moreover, if the debt is fairly priced:

$$Market\;value\;debt = D = PV(future\;interest\;payments)$$




## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**WACC with Taxes**

It is easy to see that when a firm uses debt financing, the cost of the interest it must pay is offset to some extent by the tax savings from the interest tax shield.

Assuming $\tau_c = 21\%$, D = 100,000 at 10 percent interest per year:

|                   |  
|-------------------|--------|
| Interest expense  | 10,000   |
| Tax savings  | - 2,100   | 
| After-tax cost of debt  | 7,900   | 

. . .

After-tax cost of debt is: 

$$r_d \times (1-\tau_c)$$







## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

Therefore, we can write the **After-tax WACC**:

$$r_{wacc} = \frac{E}{E+D} \times r_e + \frac{D}{E+D} \times r_d \times (1-\tau_c)$$


Or

$$r_{wacc} = \frac{E}{E+D} \times r_e + \frac{D}{E+D} \times r_d  - \frac{D}{E+D} \times r_d \times \tau_c$$





## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**Notice the decline in the WACC with Taxes. The factor ($1-\tau_c$) decreases $r_d$.**

![](figs/bm_15_2.png)











## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**The Interest Tax Shield with a Target Debt-Equity Ratio **

- Earlier we calculated the value of the tax shield assuming the firm maintains a **constant level of debt**. We can also assume that a firm maintains a constant **debt-equity ratio** instead.

- When a firm adjusts its leverage to maintain a target debt-equity ratio, we can compute its value with leverage, VL, by discounting its free cash flow using the WACC.

- The value of the interest tax shield can be found by comparing 
   - the value of the levered firm, VL, 
   - to the unlevered value, VU.








## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**Problem**

- Harris Solutions expects to have free cash flow in the coming year of **1.75 million**, and its free cash flow is expected to grow at a rate of **3.5%** per year thereafter. 

- Harris Solutions has an equity cost of capital of **12%** and a debt cost of capital of **7%**, and it pays a corporate tax rate of **40%**. 

- If Harris Solutions maintains a debt-equity ratio of **2.5**, **what is the value of its interest tax shield?**








## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**Solution**

First, compute pre-tax WACC and $V^u$.

$$=\frac{E}{E+D} \times r_e + \frac{D}{E+D} \times r_d  =  \frac{1}{1+2.5} \times 12\% + \frac{2.5}{1+2.5} \times 7\% = 8.43\%  $$

$V^u$ is: 

$$V^u = \frac{1.75\;million}{8.43\% - 3.5\%} = 35.50 \;million$$






## 15.2 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield {.smaller background="#feffee"}

**Solution**

Second, compute after-tax WACC and $V^L$.

$$=  \frac{1}{1+2.5} \times 12\% + \frac{2.5}{1+2.5} \times 7\% \times (1-0.4) = 6.43\%  $$

$V^L$ is: 

$$V^L = \frac{1.75\;million}{6.43\% - 3.5\%} = 59.73 \;million$$

. . .

The value of the interest tax shield is:

$$V^L - V^U = 59.73 - 35.50 = 24.23\;million$$













# 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield  {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

When a firm makes a significant change to its capital structure, the transaction is called a *recapitalization* (or simply a “recap”).

- **Leveraged recapitalization**:  a firm issues a large amount of debt and uses the proceeds to pay a special dividend or to repurchase shares. 
  - these transactions can reduce firm's tax payments.

. . . 

**Example**

- Assume that Midco Industries wants to boost its stock price. The company currently has **20 million shares outstanding** with a market price of **$15 per share** and **no debt**.
- Midco has had consistently stable earnings and pays a **21% tax rate**.
- Management plans to **borrow $100 million on a permanent basis**, and they will use the borrowed funds to **repurchase outstanding shares**.











## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

**Value without leverage:**

$$V_u = 20\;million\;shares \times 15 = 300\; million$$

**Present value of tax shield (after recapitalization)**

$$\tau_c \times D = 0.21 \times 100\; million = 21\;million$$

**Thus, the total value of the levered firm is**

$$300+21= 321\;million$$

**Because the value of the debt is $100 million, the value of the equity is**


$$321 - 100 = 221\;million$$








## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

Although the value of the shares outstanding drops to 221 million, **shareholders will also receive the 100 million that Midco will pay out through the share repurchase.**

In total, **they will receive the full 321 million, a gain of 21 million** over the value of their shares without leverage.

**That is, the firm has the incentive to make such Recap.**








## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

Assume Midco repurchases its shares at the current price of **$15 per share**. The firm will **repurchase 6.67 million shares**.

$$\frac{100\;million}{15} = 6.67\;million\;shares$$


Remaining:

$$20\;million - 6.67\;million = 13.33 \;million\;shares\;outstanding$$


The total value of equity is 221 million; therefore, the new share price is 16.575.


$$\frac{221\;million}{13.33} = 16.575$$

The total gain to shareholders is, again, 21 million

$$(16.575 - 15) = 1.575 \times 13.33 = 21\;million$$









## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

**Question:** If the shares are worth 16.575 per share **after the repurchase**, why would shareholders tender their shares to Midco at $15 per share?

. . .

**Arbitrage opportunity**

If investors could buy shares for $15 immediately before the repurchase and sell these shares immediately afterward at a higher price, this would represent **an arbitrage opportunity**.

. . .

Realistically, the value of the Midco’s equity will rise immediately from 300 million to 321 million after the repurchase announcement.

That is, the stock price will rise from 15 to 16.05 **immediately**.


$$\frac{321\;million}{20\;million\;shares}=16.05$$


- Midco must offer at least this price to repurchase the shares, leading to a profit of 1.05 to shareholders who sell at this price. 








## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc"}

**The takeway:**

**When securities are fairly priced, the original shareholders of a firm capture the full benefit of the interest tax shield from an increase in leverage.**

. . .

The increase from 16.05 to 16.575 is simply due to the decreased number of outstanding shares. 










## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc" visibility="hidden"}

**Problem**

Suppose Midco still chooses to borrow 100 million, but wishes to repurchase 125 million worth of its shares. **What is the lowest price it could offer and expect shareholders to tender their shares?**









## 15.3 Recap. to Capture the Tax Shield {.smaller background="#ead1dc" visibility="hidden"}

**Solution**

| Repurchase price | Shares repurchased (mil) | Shares Remaining (mil) | New share price |   
|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| $P_r$     | $R=\frac{125}{P_r}$             | $N = 20 - R$           | $P_n = \frac{221}{N}$ |
| 16.30     | 7.67                            | 12.33                  | 17.92                 |
| 16.55     | 7.55                            | 12.45                  | 17.66                 |
| 16.80     | 7.44                            | 12.56                  | 17.60                 |
| 17.05     | 7.33                            | 12.67                  | 17.44                 |
| **17.30** | **7.23**                        | **12.77**              | **17.30**             |
| 17.55     | 7.12                            | 12.88                  | 17.16                 |

# 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

Let's analyze now the effect of personal taxes on our capital structure discussion.

So far, we have looked to the benefits of leverage in the presence of **corporate taxes**. 

**The rate that corporations paid as tax is usually different than that investors pay.**

*Additionally, the cash flows to investors are typically taxed twice. Once at the corporate level and then investors are taxed again when they receive their interest or divided payment.*

. . .

Therefore, personal taxes have the potential to **offset some of the corporate tax benefits** of leverage. So, to determine the true tax benefit of leverage, we need to evaluate the **combined effect of both corporate and personal taxes**.

**For individuals:**

- Interest payments received from debt are taxed as income.
- Equity investors must pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
  - Br: investors do not pay taxes.  









##  {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

![](figs/berk_demarzo_debt_personal_taxes.jpg)





## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

- So, to debt holders: $(1-\tau_i)$

- To equity holders: $(1-\tau_c)\times(1-\tau_e)$

. . .


Also, we can write:

$$(1-\tau^*) \times (1-\tau_i) = (1-\tau_c)\times(1-\tau_e)$$


We can interpret $\tau^*$ as the **effective tax advantage of debt**: 

- if the corporation paid $(1-\tau^*)$ in interest, debt holders would receive the same amount after taxes as equity holders would receive if the firm paid 1 in profits to equity holders.

- sometimes, this is called **relative tax advantage of debt**.










## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

Using this structure, we can calculate the **Effective Advantage of Debt** as follows:

$$\tau^* = 1-\frac{(1-\tau_c)\times(1-\tau_e)}{(1-\tau_i)}$$


. . .

Notice that debt policy is irrelevant if

$$ (1-\tau_e) \times (1-\tau_c) = (1-\tau_i)$$

##  {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

![](figs/bm_15_4.jpg)







## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

**Final comments on Personal taxes**

- Tax rates vary for individual investors, and many investors are in lower tax brackets

- Holding periods might also have an effect on personal taxes

- Given the wide range of tax preferences and brackets across investors, it is difficult to know the true value of $\tau^*$ for a firm.
  - Using the top personal tax rates likely understates $\tau^*$  
  - Ignoring personal taxes likely overstates $\tau^*$ .






## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

**Final comments on Personal taxes**

- We now can write:

$$V^L = V^U + \tau^*  \times D$$


- We still compute the WACC using the corporate tax rate $\tau_c$.
  - With personal taxes the firm’s equity and debt costs of capital will adjust to compensate investors for their respective tax burdens. 
  - The net result is that a personal tax disadvantage for debt causes the WACC to decline more slowly with leverage than it otherwise would.






## 15.4 Personal Taxes {.smaller background="#cfd5ea"}

Consider the stylized Brazilian case and compute the **effective tax advantage of debt**. 

- Personal tax rate: $\tau_i$ = 27.5%
- Equity income tax rate: $\tau_e$ = 15%
- Corporate tax rate: $\tau_c$ = 39%

. . .


$$\tau^* = 1-\frac{(1-0.39)\times(1-0.15)}{(1-0.275)} = 28.5\%$$

**What does it mean?**

- Every 1 received after taxes by debt holders from interest payments costs equity holders 0.28 on an after-tax basis. 






# 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

**Do Firms Prefer Debt?**

- When firms raise new capital from investors, they do so primarily by issuing debt.
- In most years, aggregate equity issues are negative, meaning that on average, firms are reducing the amount of equity outstanding by buying shares (**see next slide**).
- Firms seem to prefer to finance investments using retained earnings (as Capex figures are greater than debt and equity issuance)




## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

  
![](figs/bm_15_5.jpg)






## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

- For the average firm, the result is that debt as a fraction of firm value has varied in a range from 30% to 45%.

![](figs/bm_15_6.jpg)







## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

- The use of debt varies greatly by industry.
- Firms in growth industries like biotechnology or high technology carry very little debt, while airlines, automakers, utilities, and financial firms have high leverage ratios.


. . . 

Additionally, many firms hold huge amounts of cash, **actually making net debt negative**.








## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

**Considering all the tax benefits of debt, why is that firms do not use more debt?**

- To answer this, we need to evaluate the limits to the tax benefit.

. . . 

**Taxable earnings**

To receive the full tax benefits of leverage, a firm need not use 100% debt financing, but the firm does need to have **taxable earnings**.

- This constraint may limit the amount of debt needed as a tax shield.









## 15.5 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}

- The optimal level of leverage from a tax saving perspective is the level such that **interest equals EBIT**.

  - Growing firms usually have no taxable earnings and therefore do not use much debt.
   
- At the optimal level of leverage, **the firm shields all of its taxable income**, and it does not have any tax-disadvantaged excess interest.

   - However, it is unlikely that a firm can predict its future EBIT (and the optimal level of debt) precisely. 
   - If there is uncertainty regarding EBIT, then there is a risk that interest will exceed EBIT. As a result, the tax savings for high levels of interest falls, possibly reducing the optimal level of the interest payment.

- In general, as a firm’s interest expense approaches its expected taxable earnings, the marginal tax advantage of debt declines, limiting the amount of debt the firm should use.

## Last comment: the Low leverage puzzle {.smaller  background="#eeffff"}


![](figs/bm_15_9.png) 

**It seems that firms are under-leveraged consistently. Therefore, there must be more to this capital structure story (chap. 16).**
