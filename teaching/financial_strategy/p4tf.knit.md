2 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> We can estimate a project’s cost of capital based on the asset or unlevered cost of capital of comparable firms in the same line of business. 

3 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> Because of default risk, the debt cost of capital, which is its expected return to investors, is less than its yield to maturity, which is its promised return. 

4 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["F"]'/> Because cash holdings will reduce a firm’s equity beta, when unlevering betas we can use the firm’s net debt, which is debt plus excess cash.

7 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> To implement the CAPM, we must (a) construct the market portfolio, and determine its expected excess return over the risk-free interest rate, and (b) estimate the stock’s beta, or sensitivity to the market portfolio. 

8 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["F"]'/> Beta corresponds to the slope of the best fitting line in the plot of a security’s excess returns versus the market’s standard deviation. 

9 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> Firm or industry asset betas reflect the market risk of the average project in that firm or industry while individual projects may be more or less sensitive to the overall market. 

10 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the discount rate used in capital budgeting to calculate the present value of cash flows arising from a project. 

11 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> An increase in a project’s systematic risk will lead to an increase in its required rate of return according to the CAPM. 

12 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["F"]'/> A firm's beta is independent of its capital structure. 

13 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> The Modigliani-Miller theorem states that in the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, and asymmetric information, the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure. 

14 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> The Modigliani-Miller theorem implies that the cost of equity is unaffected by changes in leverage when there are no taxes. 

15 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> The cost of debt is the effective rate that a company pays on its borrowed funds, including interest and other fees.

17 <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='["T"]'/> The cost of debt can be calculated using the yield to maturity (YTM) on the company's existing debt.
