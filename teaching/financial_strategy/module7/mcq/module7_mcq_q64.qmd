<strong style="display: block;">Under Modigliani and Miller Proposition I (no taxes), how does a change in the firm’s capital structure affect its weighted average cost of capital (WACC)?</strong>

<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q64" value="A"> A. Increasing leverage permanently lowers the WACC because debt is cheaper than equity.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q64" value="B"> B. The WACC remains constant because the higher cost of equity offsets the benefit of cheaper debt.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q64" value="C"> C. The WACC rises with leverage as equity becomes riskier.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q64" value="D"> D. The WACC decreases only until the firm reaches its optimal capital structure.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q64" value="E"> E. The WACC fluctuates depending on the risk-free rate.</label><br>

✅ Correct: B. In perfect capital markets with no taxes, MM Proposition I states that the firm’s total value and WACC are unaffected by leverage.  
Although equity becomes more expensive as leverage increases, this effect exactly offsets the advantage of using cheaper debt.
