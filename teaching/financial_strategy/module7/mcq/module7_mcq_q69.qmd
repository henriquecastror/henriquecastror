<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q69" value="A"> A. The firm’s overall cost of capital remains constant because the benefits of cheaper debt are offset by the higher cost of equity.</label><br>

<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q69" value="C"> C. The cost of capital increases because financial risk increases with leverage.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q69" value="D"> D. The cost of capital fluctuates depending on the firm’s debt ratio.</label><br>

✅ Correct: A. MM Proposition I (no taxes) states that a firm’s value and its overall cost of capital ($r_U$) are independent of capital structure.  
Although equity becomes riskier with more debt, the cheaper cost of debt exactly offsets this effect, keeping the weighted average cost of capital constant.
