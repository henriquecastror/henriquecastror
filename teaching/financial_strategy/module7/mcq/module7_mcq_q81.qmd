<strong style="display: block;">According to Modigliani and Miller Proposition II (no taxes), what happens to the cost of equity when a firm with $r_U = 8\%$ and $r_D = 4\%$ doubles its leverage ratio (D/E) from 1 to 2?</strong>

<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q81" value="A"> A. The cost of equity decreases because debt is cheaper than equity.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q81" value="B"> B. The cost of equity remains constant because the firm’s overall risk is unchanged.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q81" value="C"> C. The cost of equity increases slightly, but WACC rises as well.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q81" value="D"> D. The cost of equity increases linearly with leverage, but WACC remains constant.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q81" value="E"> E. Both the cost of equity and WACC increase with leverage.</label><br>

✅ Correct: D. Under MM Proposition II (no taxes), the cost of equity rises with leverage because shareholders bear more financial risk.  
The relation is $r_E = r_U + \frac{D}{E}(r_U - r_D)$, so if $D/E$ doubles from 1 to 2, $r_E$ increases linearly, while the firm’s overall cost of capital $r_U$ (or WACC) remains constant.
