<strong style="display: block;">Two firms, Alpha and Beta, are identical in every respect except their capital structure. Alpha is unlevered with $\beta_U = 1.2$. Beta has a debt-to-equity ratio $D/E = 0.5$ and no taxes. Which statement best describes the relationship between their equity betas?</strong>

<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q83" value="A"> A. Both firms have the same equity beta since they face the same business risk.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q83" value="B"> B. Beta’s equity beta is lower than Alpha’s because part of its risk is borne by debt holders.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q83" value="C"> C. Alpha’s equity beta is higher because it has no debt.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q83" value="D"> D. The equity beta of Beta depends on the cost of debt, not leverage.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module7_mcq_q83" value="E"> E. Beta’s equity beta is higher than Alpha’s because leverage amplifies equity risk.</label><br>

✅ Correct: E. With no taxes, leverage increases the sensitivity of equity returns to market risk.  
According to Modigliani–Miller Proposition II, $\beta_E = \beta_U(1 + \frac{D}{E})$.  
For $D/E = 0.5$, $\beta_E = 1.2(1 + 0.5) = 1.8$, showing that Beta’s equity is riskier than Alpha’s due to financial leverage.
