<strong style="display: block;">A firm has face-value debt of 1,000,000 due at year-end. Without new investment, its assets will be worth 900,000. A project requires an equity-funded investment of 100,000 now and produces a certain payoff of 150,000 at year-end. If equity holders finance the project, how much of the project's gain accrues to debt holders?</strong>

✅ D is correct. Without the project, creditors get 900k (short of 1m). With the project, firm value is 900k + 150k = 1,050k, so creditors get their full 1m. The increase in creditor payoff is 100k — exactly the first 100k of the project’s gain.
