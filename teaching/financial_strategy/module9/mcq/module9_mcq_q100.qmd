<strong style="display: block;">After several years of high borrowing, a firm’s management considers repurchasing 100 million of outstanding debt to reduce leverage. Financial analysts estimate that this action would increase total firm value by 15 million because it lowers expected distress costs. However, it would also transfer 20 million of value from shareholders to debt holders, since creditors would gain from the safer balance sheet. According to the leverage ratchet effect, what is the likely decision by shareholders?</strong>

✅ A is correct.  
Even though the firm’s total value would rise by 15 million, shareholders personally lose $5 million due to the value transfer to creditors.  
They will therefore oppose deleveraging — a key implication of the *leverage ratchet effect*, where equity holders resist reducing leverage even when it increases firm value.
