✅ Correct: D. The Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is the compensation investors require for bearing the additional risk of equities relative to risk-free assets.  
It is not constant: it fluctuates with economic conditions, investor sentiment, and market volatility.  
During crises or high uncertainty, ERP typically rises, while in more stable periods it tends to decline.
