Which of the following statements about the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is correct?
</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q38" value="A"> A. CAGR is simply the arithmetic average of yearly returns across the sample period.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q38" value="B"> B. CAGR always exceeds the arithmetic mean, because compounding increases long-term averages.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q38" value="C"> C. CAGR represents the constant annual rate of return that would transform the initial investment into the final value over the period, accounting for compounding.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q38" value="D"> D. CAGR is unaffected by the sequence of returns, so it is identical to the arithmetic mean in all cases.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q38" value="E"> E. CAGR is only applicable for risk-free assets and cannot be applied to risky assets like stocks.</label><br>

âœ… Correct: C. CAGR (geometric average return) reflects the annualized growth rate of an investment over multiple periods, incorporating the effect of compounding.  
Unlike the arithmetic mean, it accounts for the sequence of gains and losses and typically produces a lower value when returns are volatile.
