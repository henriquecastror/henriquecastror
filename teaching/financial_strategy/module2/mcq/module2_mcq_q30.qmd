Which of the following best explains the relationship between systematic risk and the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) in financial markets?
</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q30" value="A"> A. ERP is entirely determined by unsystematic risk, since investors demand compensation for firm-specific events.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q30" value="B"> B. ERP is constant through time, because systematic risk does not change with macroeconomic conditions.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q30" value="C"> C. ERP reflects investors’ compensation for both diversifiable and non-diversifiable risks, as both are priced equally in CAPM.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q30" value="D"> D. ERP is inversely related to systematic risk: when uncertainty rises, investors require lower premiums to invest in equities.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q30" value="E"> E. ERP compensates only for systematic risk, and its magnitude fluctuates over time with changes in macroeconomic uncertainty, investor sentiment, and global financial conditions.</label><br>

✅ Correct: E. The Equity Risk Premium (ERP) represents the additional return investors demand for bearing **systematic (non-diversifiable) risk**.  
Unlike unsystematic risk, which can be eliminated through diversification, systematic risk remains and is priced in equilibrium.  
Importantly, ERP is not fixed: it rises during crises or high uncertainty (when investors are more risk averse) and falls during stable periods.  
This dynamic relationship makes ERP central for cost of equity estimation, valuation, and risk management.
