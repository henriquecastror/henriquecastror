Which of the following statements best describes the statistical properties typically observed in daily stock returns?
</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q29" value="A"> A. Daily returns are normally distributed with constant variance over time.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q29" value="B"> B. Extreme positive and negative returns are rare, so daily returns rarely deviate from their average.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q29" value="C"> C. Daily returns exhibit volatility clustering, with periods of high variability followed by calmer periods, and they tend to have fat tails relative to a normal distribution.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q29" value="D"> D. Daily returns always follow a predictable cyclical pattern that repeats every year.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q29" value="E"> E. Since returns are independent over time, risk estimated from the past always perfectly predicts future volatility.</label><br>

âœ… Correct: C. Empirical evidence shows that daily stock returns are not perfectly normal:  
they present **volatility clustering** (turbulent periods followed by calmer ones) and **fat tails**, meaning extreme movements occur more often than predicted by the normal distribution.  
This is why models like ARCH/GARCH are often used to capture the time-varying nature of volatility.
