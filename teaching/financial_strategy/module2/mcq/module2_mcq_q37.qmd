Which of the following statements about diversification is the most accurate in the context of modern portfolio theory?
</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q37" value="A"> A. In large portfolios, all risk is eliminated because correlations converge to zero across assets.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q37" value="B"> B. The marginal benefit of adding an asset to a portfolio depends only on its own variance, not on its covariance with other assets.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q37" value="C"> C. Once a portfolio has more than 30 stocks, it is guaranteed to be free of any risk, regardless of correlations.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q37" value="D"> D. Diversification reduces unsystematic risk, but the degree of reduction depends critically on the correlations between assets; systematic risk cannot be eliminated and therefore sets a lower bound for portfolio risk.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q37" value="E"> E. International diversification always reduces portfolio risk because foreign markets are uncorrelated with domestic markets.</label><br>

✅ Correct: D. Diversification lowers unsystematic (idiosyncratic) risk, but the magnitude of the benefit depends on asset correlations. 
If correlations are high, adding more assets has limited effect; if correlations are low, the reduction is stronger. 
Systematic risk, however, cannot be diversified away — it is inherent to all investments in the market. 
Thus, diversification improves portfolio efficiency but cannot eliminate the fundamental trade-off between risk and return.
