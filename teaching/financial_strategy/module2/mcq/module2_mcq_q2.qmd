  <strong style="display: block;">Which of the following statements correctly distinguishes between variance and standard deviation as measures of risk?</strong>

  <label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q2" value="A"> A. Variance is the square root of the standard deviation.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q2" value="B"> B. Variance is generally easier to interpret because its units are squared percentage points.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q2" value="C"> C. Standard deviation is generally easier to interpret because it is in the same units as the expected return.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q2" value="D"> D. Both measures are identical and can be used interchangeably to describe total risk.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q2" value="E"> E. Variance measures systematic risk, while standard deviation measures unsystematic risk.</label><br>

âœ… Correct: C. The primary reason standard deviation is often preferred for interpretation is that its units (e.g., %) are the same as the return itself, unlike variance, which is in squared units.
