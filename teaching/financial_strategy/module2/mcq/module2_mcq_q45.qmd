âœ… Correct: B. Systematic risk arises from economy-wide shocks (e.g., interest rate hikes, recessions, inflation) that affect all firms.  
Idiosyncratic events such as lawsuits, fires, or competitive pressures are diversifiable risks that can be eliminated through holding a sufficiently large and diversified portfolio.  
This distinction underpins the CAPM framework, where only systematic risk is priced.
