The beta coefficient is a central concept in the CAPM framework. 
Which of the following statements best reflects a deeper understanding of what beta measures and its implications for asset pricing and portfolio management?
</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q35" value="A"> A. Beta represents the total volatility of an asset’s returns, capturing both systematic and unsystematic risk.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q35" value="B"> B. A stock with β = 1.5 is guaranteed to earn returns 50% higher than the market in every period.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q35" value="C"> C. Beta is calculated as the standard deviation of an asset’s returns divided by the standard deviation of the market portfolio.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q35" value="D"> D. Beta measures the sensitivity of an asset’s returns to movements in the market portfolio; it captures only systematic risk, which cannot be eliminated through diversification.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q35" value="E"> E. Beta is a backward-looking metric that reflects realized historical returns and therefore has no predictive value for expected returns.</label><br>

✅ Correct: D. Beta is the slope coefficient from regressing an asset’s returns on market returns, capturing the asset’s sensitivity to systematic (non-diversifiable) risk. 
A higher beta implies greater exposure to market movements and thus a higher required return under CAPM, while diversification cannot eliminate this component of risk.
