Which of the following statements best captures a subtle but crucial insight about diversification in modern portfolio theory?
</strong>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q48" value="A"> A. Diversification eliminates all forms of risk when enough assets are included in a portfolio.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q48" value="B"> B. As the number of securities increases, the portfolio variance declines linearly until it converges to zero.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q48" value="C"> C. Diversification reduces firm-specific (idiosyncratic) risk, but portfolio risk converges to systematic risk, which cannot be eliminated.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q48" value="D"> D. Market risk can be diversified away by holding assets from different industries and countries.</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="module2_mcq_q48" value="E"> E. The correlation between assets is irrelevant for diversification, since adding more assets always lowers risk.</label><br>

âœ… Correct: C.  
Diversification is powerful but limited: it eliminates unsystematic (firm-specific) risk, yet total portfolio risk converges to the non-diversifiable, systematic risk that depends on common factors such as the market portfolio. This insight is central to CAPM and explains why only systematic risk is priced in equilibrium.
