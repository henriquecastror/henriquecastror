## Correlation & Causality {.smaller }

It is very common these days to hear someone say ‚Äú*correlation does not mean causality*.‚Äù 

In essence, that is true.

- *The killer struck during daylight. Had the sun not been out that day, the victim would have been safe.*

- There is a correlation, but it is clear there is no causation.

. . . 

Sometimes, there is causality even when we do not observe correlation.

*The sailor is adjusting the rudder on a windy day to align the boat with the wind, but the boat is not changing direction.* ([Source: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/01-introduction#do-not-confuse-correlation-with-causality))


::: {.callout-note}

**In this example, the sailor is *endogenously* adjusting the course to balance the unobserved wind.**

:::







## The challenge  {.smaller }

- I will discuss some issues in using plain OLS models in Finance Research (mainly with panel data).

. . .

- I will avoid the word ‚Äúendogeneity‚Äù as much as possible.

  - This word refers to the violation of the Conditional Mean Independence (CMI) assumption, meaning that $x$ and $\mu$ are correlated.

. . .

- I will also avoid the word ‚Äúidentification‚Äù because identification does not guarantee causality and vice-versa (Kahn and Whited 2017)

. . .

- The discussion is mainly based on [Atanasov and Black (2016)](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/CFR-0036)

![](slides1-empiricalissues-paper.png)








## The challenge  {.smaller }

- Imagine that you want to investigate the effect of Governance on Q

    - You may have more covariates explaining Q (omitted  from slides)
  
 $ùë∏_{i} = Œ± + ùú∑_{i} √ó Gov + Controls + error$

. . . 

 All the issues in the next slides will make it not possible to infer that __changing Gov will _CAUSE_ a change in Q__ 
 
 That is, cannot infer causality
 
![](slides1-empiricalissues-wrong.jpg)








## 1) Reverse causation   {.smaller }

- Perhaps it is $Q$ that causes $Gov$.

- OLS based methods do not tell the difference between these two betas:

    - $Q_{i} = \alpha + \beta √ó Gov_{i} + Controls + \epsilon$

    - $Gov_{i} = \alpha + \beta √ó Q_{i} + Controls + \epsilon$

- If one Beta is significant, the other will most likely be significant too.

- You need a sound theory (and possibly play with lags, might not be enough)!










## 2) Simultaneity  {.smaller }

- Perhaps $Gov$ and $Q$ are determined simultaneously.

- That is, there is a third variable causing both.

- An OLS regression will provide a biased estimate of the effect.

- Also, the sign might be wrong.










## 3) Omitted variable bias (OVB)  {.smaller }

- Imagine that you do not include an important ‚Äútrue‚Äù predictor of $Q$

- Let's say, long is:  $ùë∏_{i} = \alpha_{long} + \beta_{long}* gov_{i} + Œ¥ * omitted + error$

- But you estimate short:  $ùë∏_{i} = \alpha_{short} + \beta_{short}* gov_{i} + error$

- $\beta_{short}$ will be: 

    - $\beta_{short} = \beta_{long}$ +  bias

    - $\beta_{short} = \beta_{long}$ +  relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) * effect of omitted in long (Œ¥)

        - Where: relationship between omitted (omitted) and included (Gov) is: $Omitted = \alpha + œï *Gov_{i} + \mu$

- Thus, OVB is: $\beta_{short} ‚Äì \beta_{long} = œï * Œ¥$












## 4) Bad Controls {.smaller }

- **Bad controls** are variables that are **also outcome of the treatment** (i.e., $Gov$) being studied.

- A **Bad control** could very well be a **dependent variable** of $Gov$ as well. 

- **Good controls** are variables that **you can think as being fixed** at the time of the treatment. 

    - $ùëÑ_{i} = \alpha + \beta √ó Gov_{i} + Controls + \epsilon$

- Assuming you also have something that is the consequence of good governance (e.g., Novo Mercado dummy). Should you include it in the model?

- No. In this case, the coefficient of interest no longer has a causal interpretation.


::: {.callout-warning}

**It is not hard to come up with stories of why a control is a bad control.**

## 5) Collider bias {.smaller }

**Collider bias** occurs when an independent variable and outcome each influence a **third variable and that variable or collider is included in the regression**.

  - In a way, a collider is a bad control. 
  - While a **bad control makes you underestimate the effect**, a **collider creates spurious correlation** between the X and the Y.
    
In the analysis below

  - $Q_{i} = \alpha + \beta √ó Gov_{i} + Controls + \epsilon$
    
Including, for instance, CEO Reputation (assuming that both $Q$ and $Gov$ influences CEO Reputation) creates a false correlation between $Gov$ and $Q$.

  - You may estimate a significant association even when there is none.
    
    
    
    
    





## 6) Specification error  {.smaller }

- Even if we could perfectly measure $Gov$ and all relevant covariates, we would not know for sure the functional form through which each influences $Q$.

    - Functional form: linear? Quadratic? Log-log? Semi-log?

- Misspecification of x‚Äôs is similar to OVB.








## 7) Signaling   {.smaller }

- Perhaps, some individuals are signaling the existence of an X without truly having it:

    - For instance: firms signaling they have good governance without it

- This is similar to the OVB because you cannot observe the full story.










## 8) Construct validity  {.smaller }

- Some constructs (e.g. $Gov$) are complex and sometimes have conflicting mechanisms.

- We usually don‚Äôt know for sure what ‚Äúgood‚Äù governance is, for instance.

- It is common to use imperfect proxies, that may poorly fit the underlying concept.


![](proxy variable.png) 




## 9) Measurement error   {.smaller }

- "Classical" random measurement error in **x‚Äôs** will bias the **coefficient toward zero**

    - $x^{*} = x + \sigma_{2}$
    - Imagine that $x^{*}$ is a bunch of noise. It would not explain anything.
    - Thus, your results are biased toward zero.
    
- "Classical" random measurement error in the **Y** will inflate standard errors but **will not lead to biased coefficients.** 

    - $y^{*} = y + \sigma_{1}$
    - If you estimante $y^{*} = f(x)$, you have $y + \sigma_{1} = x + \epsilon$ 
    - $y = x + u$ 
        - where $u = \epsilon + \sigma_{1}$

## 10) Heterogeneous effects  {.smaller }

- Maybe the causal effect of $Gov$ on $Q$ depends on observed and unobserved firm characteristics:

    - Let's assume that firms seek to maximize $Q$.
    - Different firms have different optimal $Gov$.
    - Firms know their optimal $Gov$.
    - If we observed all factors that affect $Q$, each firm would be at its own optimum and OLS regression would give a non-significant coefficient.

- In such case, we may find a positive or negative relationship.

- Neither is the true causal relationship.








## 11) Observation bias   {.smaller }

- This is analogous to the Hawthorne effect, in which observed subjects behave differently because they are observed.

- Firms which change gov may behave differently because their managers or employees think the change in $Gov$ matters, when in fact it has no direct effect.
 









## 12) Interdependent effects {.smaller }

- Imagine that a governance reform that will not affect share prices for a single firm might be effective if several firms adopt because investors will appreciate the reform‚Äôs impact.

- Conversely, a reform that improves efficiency for a single firm might not improve its $Q$ if adopted widely because the gains will be competed away.








## 13) Selection bias   {.smaller }

- If you run a regression with two types of companies

    - High gov (let's say they are the treated group)
    - Low gov (let's say they are the control group)

- Without any matching method, these companies are likely not comparable

    - *Apples compared to oranges*
    
- Thus, the estimated beta will contain selection bias, which can be **either be positive or negative**


  

## 14) Self-Selection {.smaller }

- Self-selection is a type of selection bias. Usually, firms decide which level of governance they adopt

- It is like they "self-select" into the treatment.

    - Units decide whether they receive the treatment or not
    
- There are reasons why firms adopt high governance

    - If observable, you need to control for. If unobservable, you have a problem.
