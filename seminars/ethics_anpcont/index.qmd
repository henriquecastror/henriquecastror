**My opinions are my own, not those of the Institution  I work for.**







## Open Science & Open Data {.smaller background="#f1f2c9"}

" _Open science encompasses unhindered access to scientific articles, **access to data from public research**, and **collaborative research** enabled by ICT tools and incentives._ 

_Broadening access to scientific publications and data is at the heart of open science, so that research outputs are in **the hands of as many as possible**, and potential benefits are **spread as widely as possible**_" ([OCDE](https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/open-science.htm)).


. . . 



**Open data** is the idea of sharing the data used in research. 

**Open code** is the idea of sharing the codes used in research. 


- Example: **COVID data** ([link](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/why-open-science-is-critical-to-combatting-covid-19-cd6ab2f9/)).
- Example: **Békes & Kézdi's "Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy" data** ([link](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/))











##  What is **NOT** a problem anymore {.smaller background="#f1f2c9"}

1) **Technology** to publish data and codes

::: incremental

- [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)

- [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/)

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

- [OSF](https://osf.io/)

- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)

- [Github](https://github.com/)

They are mostly **free**.

2) Your files **CAN** be cited

Very easy to create [PlumX metrics](https://plu.mx/plum/a/?doi=10.17632%2Fxxjvhwbz6x.1) for your files.

##  What **ARE** the problems (in my opinion) {.smaller background="#b7bfdb"}

1) Scholars' **lack** of organization [Source](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1323)

##  What **ARE** the problems (in my opinion) {.smaller background="#b7bfdb"}

1) Scholars' **lack** of organization 

::: incremental

- **Never change the original excel** (you will *never remember the changes you have made*). Instead, make data changes inside your code (i.e., Stata do file).
- Start using some solution for  **version control**. For example, Github (It is free!!).

##  What **ARE** the problems (in my opinion) {.smaller background="#b7bfdb"}

2) General **lack** of ability to review data (not so much to review codes)

- How to detect if the data has been manipulated or fabricated?

  - It is a similar challenge to  detecting Fake News.
  - But if **there are tools to detect plagiarism, why wouldn't exist tools to detect data fraud in the future?**

. . .

- **Who is in charge to detect data fraud? The journal? The reviewers?**

  - How to train reviewers to detect it?









##  What **ARE** the problems (in my opinion) {.smaller background="#b7bfdb"}

Before you have the idea to fabricate data, beware that... [Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08989629508573866)

##  What **ARE** the problems (in my opinion) {.smaller background="#b7bfdb"}

3) There are still concerns that data providers will **backslash the data-sharing movement**.

- This issue seems quiet for now...
- Unidentified data is not a reality in Accounting & Finance.
- If you do not use secondary data, you can share without concerns. 







##  What **ARE** the problems (in my opinion) {.smaller background="#b7bfdb"}


4) Journals are still **learning how to create internal protocols** to share data.

- "Code" is just a couple of files. You should share it.

  - But sharing code only goes so far. Experienced researchers can evaluate the quality of your code and use it as a subjective proxy for the quality of your work.
  - If you write good codes, you should share them. If you write bad codes, start writing good ones (simple, clear, etc.)
  - Obviously, the journal needs to be able to publish your code.
