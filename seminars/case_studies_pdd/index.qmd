##  Glocoll Participant-Centered Learning {.smaller}

**Two parts:**

- Participant-Centered Learning 

- Case writing workshop

. . . 

**Case study** is the main theme of the course, but not the only theme.

  - Participant-Centered Learning is a broader concept (includes many possible different interactions with students, such as a variety of engaging-like strategies).
  
  
  
##  Glocoll Participant-Centered Learning {.smaller}


A *case study* is not something that should have an **answer** ... 

... rather, it is a story, it is like **a corporate myth**.

- The story is context-specific, but the **dilemma, the decision is atemporal**. 





# A Framework for case writing & teaching  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

## A Framework for case writing & teaching  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}
 
This is **not a prescriptive framework**. 

- You most likely will know many examples that do not follow this framework.

This is more like a guidance that you may need to accommodate to your course and students profiles.

In the next few slides, I'll discuss some concepts or "best practices" to write & teach a case study.

. . . 

**Remember that HBS does not have undergrad courses. Cases are originally targeted to MBA students.**




 
 
## It is an individual decision {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-important}
# The case is always about **one person having to make a decision**, a protagonist. 

- One C-level person.
- One main investor.
- One main actor in the supply chain.
- One main character of a decision-making process.

___
 
- Hardly is about a collection of people, i.e., investors or customers (not practical to teach in a classroom how many people should make a decision).

:::

. . . 

**My take I **: This is at the core of the *Participant-Centered Learning* concept. Descriptive cases are nice, but are not the main thing in the case method.

. . . 

**My take II**: Also, it helps justifying "old cases". **Stories are context-specific, but decisions are 'atemporal'**, 







## The (main) decision is always clear in the case {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-warning}
# The main decision is usually stated as a question in the last paragraph of the main text.

- But this does not mean that this is the only decision.
- A good case involves more than one (but not too many) different decisions. 
  - The secondary decisions should be discovered during the case resolution.
  
:::

. . . 

**My take**: the secondary decisions are usually a "surprise" for the students. For instance, an HR decision that follows a financial (main) problem. The students may remember more and learn more from the secondary decisions.










## It needs friction  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-tip}
# Know the following: the sessions always start with a yes/no, advantages/disadvantages, pros/cons type of question.

- The decision needs "a lot at stake". The decision (and the learning) goes with friction necessarily.
- "Nothing to learn without friction".

:::

. . . 

::: {.callout-warning}
# Know the following: the sessions always start with a yes/no, advantages/disadvantages, pros/cons type of question.

- Instructors always use the board. They rarely use slides.
- Slides are used only when they want to lecture about a quantitative/operational topic. 
   - It may take one full class. But the next class goes back to a case (to apply the topic learned).

:::







## It needs friction  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

![](example.jpg)




## It needs drama  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-warning}
# Often, the decision-maker is:

- "Flying to a board meeting still not knowing what to do."
- "Driving home thinking about tomorrow's 8 am meeting."
- "Arriving at a meeting thinking about the new perspective they just thought of."

:::







## It is a good story, but this is not enough  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-warning}
# A good case is always a good story, but a good story not necessarily is a good case.

- As a case writer, it is crucial to differentiate a good story and a good case.
- A good case teaches us *something* (a good story not necessarily).
- The *something* can vary but is always related to the friction.
  - This is why I used the concept of "like a myth" before.

:::






## If the case can be multimedia, so be it  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-important}
# If possible, you can explore many forms of media.

- Newspapers (often)
- Videos, interviews, podcasts, etc.
- Corporate documents (if available)
- Etc.

:::








## Potential decisions based on Theory  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-warning}
# The problem of the protagonist should have alternatives both proactical that could be based on theory.

___

The students not always will know the theory ex-ante. In that case, this is an good opportunity to discuss briefly the theory (but the session should not turn into a lecture about the theory). 

:::




## Pastures  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

<center>
![](pastures.jpg)
</center>




## Pastures  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

The case has two to four pastures.

- During a session, instructors rarely give the "answer" of a pasture, but they **conduct quite clearly** the movement between pastures.

- The pasture should be trivial to the instructor in the main text (at least in the teaching notes). It might not be clear to an expert student. It almost never not clear to a begginer. 

. . .

**My take**: As a instructor (that knows the theory and how often things are done), it is hard to stay too long in a pasture. It seems a waste of time. 

- But in a trilling group/session, staying in a pasture almost always teach us something about a new perspective.





## A good case has clear learning objectives  {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-warning}
# A case needs clear learning objectives.

- Each pasture has its own learning objective.
- The same case can be taught differently, accommodating different learning objectives due to different audiences/courses. 
- **Managing students expectations very early on is crucial**.
  - If students don't prepare, the pastures get mixed, and the learning objectives are never fulfilled. 

:::







## Teaching plan comes often before the writing   {.smaller background="#d0e0e3"}

::: {.callout-warning}
# How to develop a case?

1) Idea

2) Teaching Plan

3) Protagonist interview (often only one, but it is posible to have more than one)

4) Teaching & Teaching notes

5) Improve Teaching notes

# How to cope with the main "issues" of teaching with cases? {background="#fff2cc"}


## How to cope with the main "issues"? {.smaller background="#fff2cc"}

- *Students may say I am frustrated because the case has no solution.*

  - More common in undergrad students. Usually, students demand the "right" answer. 
  - But the idea is there is no right answer in a good dilema. 

. . . 

- *They don't want concepts, they want solved problems*.

  - It might be a generational thing.
  - The tip is to go back to the fundamentals of making a decision. (If you were in the protagonist's shoes, what would you do?)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
## How to cope with the main "issues"? {.smaller background="#fff2cc"}

- *Audience Heterogeneity* (in grad. courses)

  - Half-full glass solution: this allows "new" perspectives in a given pasture.
  
  
  

. . . 

- *What happens is the "correct" answer*
  
  - Almost always they don't discuss what happened.
  - Students are informed that the decisions/oppinions should be extracted from the case.
    - If a students brings something out of the case, they get penalized in the grading.

## The framework {background="#b1d6fc" .smaller}

- **Define the protagonist**

  - as far as I know, the most likely person to focus in on the CEO that revealed the scandal, but we could focus on a director, or an important investor as well).
  - a crucial factor is to have access to that person and that he or she is willing to talk about the events (not trivial in this example, I assume).





##  {background="#b1d6fc" .smaller}

- **Define the learning objectives**

  - This is most likely a financial/accounting case, but it could be a governance or a supply chain case.
  
::: incremental    
   - **Accounting aspects:** *risco sacado*, accounting aspects of supplier financing vs debt financing, effects in the income statement, etc.
   - **Finance aspects:** differences of debt vs suppliers in the balance sheet? cost of debt vs. cost of suppliers? What are the consequences in terms of collateral?, etc.  
   - **(Overlap) Legal aspects**: what was illegal and what was legal? the law has been bent? Do the creditors have a case to go to the court?
   - **(Overlap) Governance**: what governance mechanism has failed? Was it a governance issue, in the first place? How could we improve the governance based on this case? 
   - **(Overlap) Supply chain**: what features of the supply chain allowed this problem? Is it an industry thing or it is more common than we imagine? What is the impact of the supply chain in the valuation of a company?

- *Como ter ideias para escrever estudos de caso?*
- *Como ser mais efetiva na aplicação de casos com alunos da graduação, gerando reflexões e conexão com desafios atuais das organizações?*
- *Como definir amostragem para o recorte acadêmico necessário?*
- *Considerando que sou professora de penal e processo penal, quero mais ouvir e verificar o que posso utilizar, sobretudo para mesurar os problemas com base em estatísticas judiciais ou outras métricas.*
- *Como transformar experiências de consultorias em publicação de casos na GV Casos e outras revistas relevantes.*
