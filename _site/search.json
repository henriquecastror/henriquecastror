Experienced researchers can evaluate the quality of your code and use it as a subjective proxy for the quality of your work.\nIf you write good codes, you should share them. If you write bad codes, start writing good ones (simple, clear, etc.)\nObviously, the journal needs to be able to publish your code."

    "title": "How to create an effective master’s presentation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post aims to help students who are about to present the master’s dissertation to the committee. I hope it is helpful to you!\nIf you are presenting a Ph.D. thesis, the depth of each slide changes a bit (and the time you have also increases by some minutes, to 20-25 minutes), but the order and structure are the same.\nFirst, ask your supervisor how long is the meeting expected to last. Usually, it is about 1h, but it can vary from school to school.\nThen, ask how long you have to present. Usually, master students have about 15 to 20 minutes. When you find that out, assume this is your most important rule to follow. You have to stick with the expected time.\nAssuming you have 15 minutes, you should not create more than 7 to 8 slides (9 to 10 in total, see below). Assume 2 min per slide. Professors won’t pay attention to presentations with 20, 30 slides.\nRemember that professors in your committee are experts in the topic of your dissertation. So don’t bother them with unnecessary explanations. You have to show that you know what you are talking about and you are all over your work, but remember that you are the rookie in the room. So stick to the time that is allocated to you.\nIf you have 8 slides, you should use the first 2 to a) give the context of your work, b) motivate your research, c) justify why it is important, d) discuss the research question. This order can vary throughout the slides, but it is almost mandatory to present these four topics. You can use chapter 1 of your dissertation to create these slides.\nThen, slide #3 should contain the theory that you used in your work. Avoid long paragraphs (nobody will have the time to read them while listening to you) and prefer to cite articles using bullets. You must be prepared to discuss each of the articles you mention in this slide (and all articles you cite in the dissertation, for that matter). You can include one or two short sentences to aggregate somehow the articles you cite, but do not include full paragraphs in your slides to discuss a specific article (you can use the appendix for that, see below).\nYou use slides #4 and #5 to discuss your empirical design. Again, avoid entire paragraphs and discuss using bullets, equations, and perhaps figures. Also, discuss the sample, any instrumental variable, any adjustment you made, etc. Be prepared to talk for around 3 to 4 minutes about these 2 slides since professors will pay a lot of attention to this part of your presentation. This might be the most critical part of your talk.\nYou have 2 slides to present the results. Avoid tables, but you can use part of them with extreme caution. If you want to include something from a table, include only the part that matters (and draw professors’ attention to the pages of your dissertation where the table is). It is always a good idea to come out with a figure to present the results if you can have one.\nFinally, use the final slides for your concluding remarks. Again, avoid entire paragraphs, and prefer using bullets.\nThere you go! 8 slides to a 15-min presentation!\nThis is how I see a nice master presentation, but these are not rules. If you feel you need 1 or 2 more slides, you can have it. However, do not use more time than expected!\nIn total, you may have 10 slides because you can use the first slide to include the title of your dissertation and your name, and the latter to include the same information again with a “Thank you for your attention” message. You do not spend time with these slides; they are there only to “initiate” and “conclude” your presentation, respectively. They are usually the slides that you keep on the screen while the real discussion is happening.\n\nAppendix\nIf you feel necessary, you can include additional information (perhaps an entire paragraph or a table) that you did not have in the first 8 slides of content. Include any information you want after the “Thank you for your attention” slide. You will not use these slides in the original 15 minutes you have. You will only use them if professors ask something you do not have in the first 8 slides.\nThese are the slides to make you comfortable that you will not forget anything about your work and have the means to explain parts that you did not have time to explain in the original 15 minutes. The appendix is like your insurance to make sure you can answer all their questions.\n\n\nAdditional comments\n\nCome prepared to discuss all parts of your work. Professors will probably ask for clarifications about specific details that she or he did not understand. More specifically, after you use your 15 minutes, your supervisor will provide time to each member of the committee to ask you questions, make comments and say anything they want to say. Usually, each professor uses about 15 minutes, but your supervisor will not cut their time if they need more.\nThis experience is one of those moments in time when you learn a lot about your own work and academia in general. So take notes of all comments that professors make to you. Prefer taking notes by hand, since handwriting increases learning, boosts memory, and is more friendly than typing.\nAlmost always, professors see issues in your main text and make recommendations for dealing with these issues. Your notes will help you later to make such corrections. Your supervisor is not obliged to take notes for you.\nAlmost always, you will have to provide a second version of your dissertation correcting the issues professors see. So, if you do not take notes, you will have trouble making such corrections.\nAfter all professors state their comments, your supervisor will invite them to a closed room to decide the result of your presentation. They usually take 15 minutes to discuss your work to reach a conclusion. These days, when most presentations occur via Zoom, most likely, your supervisor and all professors go to a breakout room, while all other participants stay in the main room.\nWhen professors are done discussing, they come back to the main room to announce the result. The outcomes vary from school to school but are mainly one of these three: 1) you are not approved and receive 60 to 90 days to make all corrections asked and present your work again to the committee; 2) you are approved, but you have to provide a second version of your work with all corrections made, 3) you are approved without modifications asked. The most common outcome is #2, but it can be #1 or #3.\n\nThat is it! Good luck with your presentation!"

More about the clarifications in : https://www.v-dem.net/static/website/img/refs/codebookv12.pdf\n\n\nElectoral democracy index (D) (v2x_polyarchy)\nClarification: The electoral principle of democracy seeks to embody the core value of making rulers responsive to citizens, achieved through electoral competition for the electorate’s approval under circumstances when suffrage is extensive; political and civil society organizations can operate freely; elections are clean and not marred by fraud or systematic irregularities; and elections affect the composition of the chief executive of the country. In between elections, there is freedom of expression and an independent media capable of presenting alternative views on matters of political relevance. In the V-Dem conceptual scheme, electoral democracy is understood as an essential element of any other conception of representative democracy —liberal, participatory, deliberative, egalitarian, or some other.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_polyarchy) ) +   geom_line(aes(colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Electoral democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Electoral democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal democracy index (D) (v2x_libdem)\nClarification: The liberal principle of democracy emphasizes the importance of protecting individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority. The liberal model takes a “negative” view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government. This is achieved by constitutionally protected civil liberties, strong rule of law, an independent judiciary, and effective checks and balances that, together, limit the exercise of executive power. To make this a measure of liberal democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_libdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Liberal democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Liberal democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipatory democracy index (D) (v2x_partipdem)\nClarification: The participatory principle of democracy emphasizes active participation by citizens in all political processes, electoral and non-electoral. It is motivated by uneasiness about a bedrock practice of electoral democracy: delegating authority to representatives. Thus, direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. This model of democracy thus takes suffrage for granted, emphasizing engagement in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational elected bodies. To make it a measure of participatory democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_partipdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Participatory democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Participatory democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliberative democracy index (D) (v2x_delibdem)\nClarification: The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions—as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levels—from preference formation to final decision—among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. To make it a measure of not only the deliberative principle but also of democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_delibdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Deliberative democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Deliberative democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgalitarian democracy index (D) (v2x_egaldem)\nClarification: The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate. Egalitarian democracy is achieved when 1 rights and freedoms of individuals are protected equally across all social groups; and 2 resources are distributed equally across all social groups; 3 groups and individuals enjoy equal access to power. To make it a measure of egalitarian democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_egaldem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Egalitarian democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Egalitarian democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for passing by!"

Governance here is measured by the six following variables:\n\nVoice and Accountability\nPolitical Stability and Absence of Violence\nGovernment Effectiveness\nRegulatory Quality\nRule of Law\nControl of Corruption\n\nBefore we continue, it is important to know what these variables are measuring: they measure Brazilians’ perception about governance, they do not measure governance per se.

Perception here is the crucial word, so let’s keep that in mind.\nAlso, the six variables are measured on a scale from -2.5 to 2.5.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Accounting discretion around the world: what are the outcomes?\nPrevious corporate governance literature suggests that investors and regulators fear possible opportunistic behaviors coming from managerial discretion; thus, mechanisms (such as governance mechanisms and legal rules) are placed to reduce their discretion. This literature usually defines managerial discretion as the latitude of action allowed to managers and uses firm-level configurations (such as low levels of leverage or ownership concentration) to proxy for it. In this manuscript, we propose a different form of discretion coming from accounting rules, which we name as accounting discretion. Specifically, we investigate systematic differences in accounting that are linked with or provide discretion to managers in 52 countries. We use local accounting rules to assess accounting discretion and to build an index measuring the level of accounting discretion allowed in each country. Our accounting discretion index suggests there is significant variability across the 52 countries in our sample. We argue that understanding country-level variability in accounting discretion is crucial to understand overall managerial discretion at the firm-level. We contribute to the literature by providing an objective measure of accounting discretion across different countries.\nCo-authored with Marcio Pimenta (PhD Candidate).\nThe first article of this project was accepted for presentation at the 6th annual International Corporate Governance Society (ICGS) conference to be held November 14 - 16, 2020."

The purpose is to synthesize and appraise the extant empirical research on the interplay between country- and firm-level governance mechanisms and the effects on firm outcomes. Particular focus is placed on studies that examine firm economic performance.\n\n\nResearch Findings/Results:\nWe identify and distinguish between two groups of cross-national governance studies. The first type compares macro, country-level outcomes and the second compares three different firm-level outcomes: economic performance, governance mechanisms, and strategic decisions. We compare the theoretical frameworks used and further analyze the country-level factors and firm-level governance attributes that have been combined to investigate their interplay and the effects on firm outcomes. We find substantial variation in the use and measurement of country-level factors as well as a variety of causal forms used to explain the combined effects of country- and firm-level governance mechanisms. This wide variability precludes comparison, and consequently prevents identifying consistent patterns of influence between country-level governance factors and firm-level governance mechanisms and/or performance. We identify research gaps and provide fruitful directions for future research on this topic.\n\n\nTheoretical Implications:\nThe cross-national governance research has been guided mainly by an economic perspective focusing on international differences in the effectiveness of specific governance mechanisms. Few comparative studies have integrated an institutional perspective or examined the external forces that drive the diffusion and use of specific governance mechanisms. Such integrative framework would improve the understanding of cross-national differences in the salient dimensions of country-level governance factors and how they mediate the effectiveness of firm-level governance mechanisms.\n\n\nPractitioner Implications:\nOur results reveal that firm- and country-level governance mechanisms have been interacted and combined, either to address various agency problems or to compensate for a weak national environment. This calls for regulators and investors to consider national governance factors when assessing firm-level governance practices.\nCo-authored with Eduardo Schiehll."

    "text": "Country-level governance quality, ownership concentration, and debt maturity: A comparative study of Brazil and Chile\n\n\nResearch Question/Issue:\nThis study investigates the interplay between country-level governance quality and the capital structure choice at the firm level in Brazil and Chile. We examine the association between a firm’s ownership concentration and its debt maturity structure and whether country-level governance quality influences this association.\n\n\nResearch Findings/Results:\nUsing a large firm-level dataset from Brazil and Chile for the period 2008-2013, we find a positive association between low ownership concentration and debt maturity. However, this association becomes negative when the largest shareholder has high ownership concentration. This result suggests that long-term debt and ownership concentration act as substitute monitoring mechanisms. Moreover, debt maturity is inversely related to our aggregated index of country-level governance quality, suggesting that in countries with governance systems that effectively protect debt holders, firms with high benefits of control (high ownership concentration) will use debt with shorter repayment periods in order to benefit from frequent monitoring by debt holders. Overall, our results support the view that financial markets tend to pressure firms with high benefits of control or greater agency conflict to make a tradeoff between the benefits of control and the cost and maturity structure of debt financing.\n\n\nTheoretical Implications:\nThis study contributes to the research on comparative corporate governance and capital structure. We also respond to recent calls to bridge the gap between under- and over-socialized views of corporate governance by examining the interplay between firm- and country-level governance variables. Our findings suggest a substitution effect between monitoring by equity holders and by debt holders, and that country-level governance quality exerts a disciplinary influence over a firm’s choice of debt maturity structure.\n\n\nPractitioner Implications:\nInvestors seeking to enter emerging markets such as Brazil and Chile can benefit from considering national governance factors that enhance debt holders’ external monitoring effectiveness. Because our findings show the importance of considering and improving the quality of country-level governance, they are also useful for policy makers aiming to reform corporate governance practices in emerging markets.\nCo-authored with Eduardo Schiehll and Paulo Terra."

Our sample covers more than 6,000 firms from 29 countries (roughly 16,000 observations during 2010-2013). We find that the entrenchment-cash holdings association is sensitive to the level of shareholder protection but not to the level of creditor rights. Moreover, we find that the way shareholder protection shapes this association depends upon how managers become entrenched. When managers become entrenched through ownership, shareholders consent to their preferences to hold more cash, whereas, when managers become entrenched through CEO duality, shareholders force them to disgorge cash. We interpret our findings as evidence that shareholders agree to increase cash when managers are aligned with them by ownership but prefer to decrease cash when they are not aligned, whereas creditors do not influence entrenched managers’ cash holdings decisions."

However, in countries with strong levels of both minority shareholder and creditor protection, investment–cash flow sensitivity increases. Our results remain robust after controlling for several alternative explanations. The results support the argument that overregulation arises when policymakers increase investor protection at levels that lead firms to avoid external sources of finance, hampering firm investment.

    "text": "Does control concentration affect board busyness? International evidence\n\nAbstract:\nPrevious literature suggests that shareholders can concentrate control without cash flow rights, creating incentives to expropriate firm resources. However, previous research does not help identify the board structure of firms whose controlling shareholder has an inflated control concentration. We investigate whether and how firm control concentration affects the structure of the board of directors. Building upon the literature on busy boards, we investigate specific characteristics of the board of directors: the number of directors’ directorships and the number of committee positions. We study an initial sample of 8688 firms from 41 countries. After using propensity score matching to mitigate selection bias, we keep 3570 firms. We find that controlling shareholders with higher control concentration select board members with more directorships and fewer committee positions. We interpret this result as evidence supporting the signaling incentive hypothesis, which suggests that controlling shareholders prefer a more shareholder-friendly board structure, possibly to signal the market that they pursue decisions that maximize firm value. The results are robust to several alternative specifications and methods. Our study helps fill gaps in the literature on busy boards by showing the consequences of the incentives of shareholders with concentrated control on how firms allocate the time of their busy directors. Our study also sheds light on the theoretical aspects that affect the preferences of those shareholders who can most harm minority shareholders. Finally, our study has practical implications that could help regulatory institutions make recommendations for the compositions of boards of directors and/or committees.\nCo-authored with Cristiano Machado Costa."

However, traditional corporate governance mechanisms designed to curb agency problems may undermine firm growth because they are mostly backward-looking and inherently problematic when facing uncertainty. In fact, they may restrain or disincentivize managerial creativeness and alertness, which can be instrumental to maximize firm value. Our goal is to advance a conceptual framework that integrates into corporate governance elements literature factors that are key for creativity but which have been overlooked in corporate governance. Drawing on a combination of creativity and entrepreneurship literatures, we discuss two parameters—unlikelihood and opacity—which serve as the basis to propose four different types of entrepreneurial projects. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the optimal corporate governance configurations for each project types. Our framework can inform the design of better tailored governance mechanisms that are specific to a firm’s environment and its projects.\nArticle co-authored with Michael Araki."

    "text": "Integrating uncertainty and governance into a capital structure puzzle: can risk-taking and rule-taking explain zero-leverage firms?\n\nAbstract:\nThis study uses a multidisciplinary lens to investigate new determinants of the puzzling phenomenon of zero leverage, where firms contain only equity in their capital structure. We draw on insights from entrepreneurship and creativity theories, alongside traditional corporate governance (CG) literature, to reframe the construct of risk-taking and develop the novel construct of rule-taking, which entails compliance with powerful outside parties and current best practices of CG. We hypothesize that risk-taking is associated with a wider wedge of information and costs regarding internal and external financing, leading to a greater likelihood of debt eschewing. Conversely, rule-taking is hypothesized to reduce the range of acceptable choices in the firm, which makes the adoption of the “aberrant” behavior of zero-leverage less likely. Using 9222 firm-observations from 37 countries, the results corroborate our hypotheses, showing a positive (negative) association between risk-taking (rule-taking) and zero leverage. The results are robust to several alternative specifications and matching samples. Our study offers insights to policymakers and investors to clarify the antecedents of zero-leverage behavior as a strategy to deal with the information gap between insiders and outsiders. Our perspective underscores the existence of an inherent communication penalty between an insider and an outsider when the former is performing actions that are non-typical under the oversight of the latter. Thus, by deepening understanding on risk-taking and rule-taking, we provide a more nuanced view of how firms can optimize capital and CG structures, with special implications for the adoption of well-tailored bundles of CG mechanisms under different circumstances.\nArticle co-authored with Michael Araki."

In this article, we propose a typology of firms’ projects drawing on two parameters stemming from recent advancements in creativity theory: opacity and unlikelihood. This results in a matrix with four types of projects that display different qualities of entrepreneurialness: replicative projects, incubation projects, insightful projects, and innovative projects. We draw on the knowledge governance literature to suggest mechanisms and strategies of governance based on the prevailing type of project that the organization pursues. Our framework contributes to the theoretical understanding of the interplay between governance, creativity, and entrepreneurship literature while offering practical insights for designing better-tailored governance mechanisms that align with a firm’s prevailing project type.\nArticle co-authored with Michael Araki."

Angel investors often circumvent this problem by holding either a convertible note or a SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) rather than equity.\n\nUsually, angel investors have a share price discount over new investors.\nStructuring the deal in this way allows angels and entrepreneurs to agree on terms without agreeing on a value for the firm, instead postponing the valuation decision until the firm is more mature and attractive to venture capitalists."

After the dividend, the shareholder owns 150 shares.\nBecause the portfolio is still worth 4,200, the stock price will fall to 28 (\\(\\frac{4,200}{150}\\)).\n\nSometimes, firms finance new shares. So, it is like shareholders have received cash and immediately bought new shares. In this case, decline in price is not as large as above."

You can use the row below to see the codes of all variables available.\n\nall_series &lt;- available_series()\n\nThen, after learning the codes for the variables we want (i.e., the codes ‘GM366_IBVSP366’ and ‘GM366_ERC366’ below), you download the data.\n\nibov  &lt;- ipeadata(code = \"GM366_IBVSP366\")\ndolar &lt;- ipeadata(code = \"GM366_ERC366\")\n\nSee that the period available is different for the two variables.\nFor convenience, let’s delete some columns in Ibov and integrate the dollar to Ibov.\n\nibov &lt;-subset(ibov, select=-c(tcode,uname))\ndolar&lt;-subset(dolar, select=-c(tcode,uname))\n\nThe next step is to join the data by date to avoid using different periods in each dataframe.\n\ndata &lt;- merge(ibov,dolar, by = \"date\")\n\nThen, let’s calculate the ratio between Ibovespa and dollar each day.\n\ndata$ibov_dolar &lt;- (data$value.x/data$value.y)\n\nLastly, you are good to go, and you can create a graph as follows.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nggplot(data) +   geom_line(aes(x = date, y=ibov_dolar, colour=\"Ibov USD\") ) +   geom_line(aes(x = date, y=value.x, colour=\"Ibov\") ) +\n  labs(y='Ibov in USD', \n       title = \"Graph of Ibov in USD (Period: since 1994)\",\n       caption = \"Source: Ipeadata (R package: ipeadatar)\") + theme_solarized()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph is simply a reminder of the value in dollar of our Stock market index.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Do shareholder protection and creditor rights have distinct effects on the association between debt maturity and ownership structure?\n\nAbstract:\nThis study examines the effects of the firm’s ownership concentration and its institutional environment on corporate debt maturity choices. As ownership concentration and debt maturity are alternative governance mechanisms, we theorize and investigate whether their association is influenced by country-level governance factors that enhance outside monitoring by minority shareholders and debtholders. Our investigation is based on a dataset of 50,599 firm-year observations from 38 countries. We use a propensity-score matching approach and find that the effect of ownership concentration on debt maturity is conditional to country-level governance attributes. Ownership concentration has a negative effect on debt maturity in countries where both shareholder protection and creditor rights are weak. Ownership concentration, however, tends to lengthen debt maturity as protection increases, and this positive effect on the length of debt maturity is stronger in countries enhancing protection towards debtholders (instead of shareholders). We also explore other characteristics of ownership structure, such as the identity and presence of controlling shareholders. These results corroborate the view that entrenched shareholders may use debt maturity opportunistically. Our study provides new insights into the interplay between firm- and country-level governance mechanisms and a deeper understanding of cross-country differences in the association between ownership structure and debt financing.\nCo-authored with Eduardo Schiehll and Paulo Terra."

The most common reason given for this is that economists are oftentimes skeptical that CIA can be achieved in any dataset almost as an article of faith. This is because for many applications, economists as a group are usually more concerned about selection on unobservables than they are selection on observables, and as such, they reach for matching methods less often.\nCIA = CMI"

The user starts by choosing the covariates that should be included in the reweighting.\nFor each covariate, the user then specifies a set of balance constraints (in Equation 5) to equate the moments of the covariate distribution between the treatment and the reweighted control group.\nThe moment constraints may include the mean (first moment), the variance (second moment), and the skewness (third moment).\n\nThe outcome is a vector containing the weights to weight the observations, such that the weighted average, weighted variance, and weighted skewness of the covariates in control group are similar to those in the treatment group"

It is not an evidence that CMI is nos violated.\nIn fact, the OLS “assumes” and “forces” zero correlation.\nIt is intuitive: if you are “forcing” zero correlation when the correlation is not in fact zero, your coefficients will be biased.\nThe previous graphs actually show zero correlation. But that is expected and does not suggest the model is not violating CMI.\nAt the end of the day, CMI is untestable and unverifiable."

You also eliminate the intercept \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\nTakeaway: OLS will estimate unbiased coefficients if you demean the variables.\nThis is called within-transformation because you are demeaning “within” the group."

    "text": "First differences\nIn most applications, the main reason for collecting panel data is to allow for the unobserved effect, \\(c_i\\), to be correlated with the explanatory variables.\nFor example, in the crime equation, we want to allow the unmeasured city factors in \\(c_i\\) that affect the crime rate also to be correlated with the unemployment rate.\nIt turns out that this is simple to allow: because \\(c_i\\) is constant over time, we can difference the data across the two years.\nMore precisely, for a cross-sectional observation \\(i\\), write the two years as:\n\\[y_{i,1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1} + c_i + \\mu_{i,1}, t=1\\]\n\\[y_{i,2} = (\\beta_0 + \\delta_0) + \\beta_1 x_{i,2} + c_i + \\mu_{i,2}, t=2\\]\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we obtain\n\\[(y_{i,2} - y_{i,1}) = \\delta_0 + \\beta_1 (x_{i,2} - x_{i,1}) + (\\mu_{i,2}-\\mu_{i,1})\\]\n\\[\\Delta y_{i} = \\delta_0 + \\beta_1 \\Delta x_{i} + \\Delta \\mu_{i}\\]"

The user starts by choosing the covariates that should be included in the reweighting.\nFor each covariate, the user then specifies a set of balance constraints (in Equation 5) to equate the moments of the covariate distribution between the treatment and the reweighted control group.\nThe moment constraints may include the mean (first moment), the variance (second moment), and the skewness (third moment).\n\nThe outcome is a vector containing the weights to weight the observations, such that the weighted average, weighted variance, and weighted skewness of the covariates in control group are similar to those in the treatment group"

When later round investors accept securities with equal priority, they are said to be pari passu.\n. . .\nAnti-Dilution Protection: If things are not going well and the firm raises new funding at a lower price than in a prior round, it is referred to as a “down round.” Anti-dilution protection lowers the price at which investors in earlier rounds can convert their shares to common, effectively increasing their ownership percentage in a down round at the expense of founders and employees.\n. . .\nExit Strategy: It details how investors will eventually realize the return from their investment"

Because each individual type I firm is risky, should investors expect to earn a risk premium when investing in type I firms?\n\nThe risk premium for diversifiable risk is zero, so investors are not compensated for holding firm-specific risk.\n\nThe reason is that they can mitigate this part of risk through diversification.\nDiversification eliminates this risk for free, implying that all investors should have a diversified portfolio.

Later, you buy it back (but if the price goes up, you lose part of your investment).\nNotice that if you can short sale, you amplify the pairs return-risk available."

Then, the costs of financial distress increase, reducing the value of the levered firm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tradeoff theory states that firms should increase their leverage until it reaches the level for which the firm value is maximized. At this point, the tax savings that result from increasing leverage are perfectly offset by the increased probability of incurring the costs of financial distress."

Dividends is a stronger signal in this regard.\nAlso, a firm may announce a share repurchase program but not repurchase any shares. It is not mandatory to buy back shares. But once the firm announces dividends payment, it has to pay."

    "text": "17.7 Stock Dividends, Splits, Spin-Offs\nStock Dividends\n\nWith a stock dividend, a firm does not pay out any cash to shareholders. As a result, the total market value of the firm’s equity is unchanged.\nThe only thing that is different is the number of shares outstanding. The stock price will therefore fall because the same total equity value is now divided over a larger number of shares.\n\n\n\nSuppose Genron paid a 50% stock dividend rather than a cash dividend.\nA shareholder who owns 100 shares (price = $42) before the dividend has a portfolio worth 4,200. After the dividend, the shareholder owns 150 shares.\nBecause the portfolio is still worth 4,200, the stock price will fall to 28 (\\(\\frac{4,200}{150}\\)).\n\nSometimes, firms finance new shares. So, it is like shareholders have received cash and immediately bought new shares. In this case, decline in price is not as large as above."

Findings of G are more ambiguous.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults contradict US-based findings: Fernández-Kranz and Santaló (2010), Flammer (2015b), and Leong and Yang (2020).\n\nThis is the interesting part of this article.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagers from emerging markets decrease ESG performance to face more challenging and uncertain times, supporting the view that they invest in these practices for altruistic purposes."

Managers with better information may strategically set a firm’s payout to communicate their private knowledge to the market.\n6  According to the dividend signaling hypothesis, when a company increases its dividend payments, it generally signals that it expects lower future earnings.\n7  According to the Modigliani-Miller theorem, in the absence of taxes, dividend policy has a significant impact on a firm’s overall value.\n8  Paying dividends reduces a firm’s retained earnings, but it does not affect its cash reserves.\n9  Dividend policy can signal management’s confidence in the firm’s future earnings to the market.\n10  According to the bird-in-the-hand theory, investors are indifferent between dividends and capital gains.\n11  Share repurchases can increase earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\n12  Dividend irrelevance theory states that the choice between paying dividends and retaining earnings affects a firm’s stock price in a perfect market.\n13  A high dividend payout ratio can limit a firm’s ability to reinvest in growth opportunities.\n14  Dividend payments are tax-deductible expenses for a firm.\n15  Stable dividend policies can attract investors seeking predictable income streams.\n16  Firms that do not pay dividends are always undervalued by the market.\n17  Dividend payout decisions can be influenced by the firm’s target capital structure.\n18  A firm’s life cycle stage can influence its dividend policy, with mature firms more likely to pay dividends than growth firms.\n19  A stock dividend increases the total value of a shareholder’s investment.\n20  A reduction in dividend payments can signal financial distress to the market.\n21  Dividend payments have no impact on a firm’s liquidity.\n22  Firms might choose to pay special dividends during periods of exceptionally high earnings or excess cash reserves.\n23  In the presence of agency costs, high dividend payouts can reduce the free cash flow available for managers to waste.\n24  Share repurchases and dividends are taxed the same way under all tax regimes.\n25  The clientele effect suggests that different groups of investors prefer different dividend policies.\n26  Increasing dividends always leads to a higher stock price.\n27  Dividend signaling hypothesis suggests that changes in dividend payments convey information about a firm’s future prospects.\n28  Retaining earnings instead of paying dividends is always the best approach for maximizing firm value.\n29  Companies with volatile earnings may prefer to pay lower dividends to maintain flexibility.\n30  Firms should always distribute all their earnings as dividends."
