More about the clarifications in : https://www.v-dem.net/static/website/img/refs/codebookv12.pdf\n\n\nElectoral democracy index (D) (v2x_polyarchy)\nClarification: The electoral principle of democracy seeks to embody the core value of making rulers responsive to citizens, achieved through electoral competition for the electorate’s approval under circumstances when suffrage is extensive; political and civil society organizations can operate freely; elections are clean and not marred by fraud or systematic irregularities; and elections affect the composition of the chief executive of the country. In between elections, there is freedom of expression and an independent media capable of presenting alternative views on matters of political relevance. In the V-Dem conceptual scheme, electoral democracy is understood as an essential element of any other conception of representative democracy —liberal, participatory, deliberative, egalitarian, or some other.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_polyarchy) ) +   geom_line(aes(colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Electoral democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Electoral democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal democracy index (D) (v2x_libdem)\nClarification: The liberal principle of democracy emphasizes the importance of protecting individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority. The liberal model takes a “negative” view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government. This is achieved by constitutionally protected civil liberties, strong rule of law, an independent judiciary, and effective checks and balances that, together, limit the exercise of executive power. To make this a measure of liberal democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_libdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Liberal democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Liberal democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipatory democracy index (D) (v2x_partipdem)\nClarification: The participatory principle of democracy emphasizes active participation by citizens in all political processes, electoral and non-electoral. It is motivated by uneasiness about a bedrock practice of electoral democracy: delegating authority to representatives. Thus, direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. This model of democracy thus takes suffrage for granted, emphasizing engagement in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational elected bodies. To make it a measure of participatory democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_partipdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Participatory democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Participatory democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliberative democracy index (D) (v2x_delibdem)\nClarification: The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions—as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levels—from preference formation to final decision—among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. To make it a measure of not only the deliberative principle but also of democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_delibdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Deliberative democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Deliberative democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgalitarian democracy index (D) (v2x_egaldem)\nClarification: The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate. Egalitarian democracy is achieved when 1 rights and freedoms of individuals are protected equally across all social groups; and 2 resources are distributed equally across all social groups; 3 groups and individuals enjoy equal access to power. To make it a measure of egalitarian democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_egaldem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Egalitarian democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Egalitarian democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\nThanks for passing by!"

    "title": "Accounting Discretion",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Previous corporate governance literature suggests that investors and regulators fear possible opportunistic behaviors coming from managerial discretion; thus, mechanisms (such as governance mechanisms and legal rules) are placed to reduce their discretion. This literature usually defines managerial discretion as the latitude of action allowed to managers and uses firm-level configurations (such as low levels of leverage or ownership concentration) to proxy for it. In this manuscript, we propose a different form of discretion coming from accounting rules, which we name as accounting discretion. Specifically, we investigate systematic differences in accounting that are linked with or provide discretion to managers in 52 countries. We use local accounting rules to assess accounting discretion and to build an index measuring the level of accounting discretion allowed in each country. Our accounting discretion index suggests there is significant variability across the 52 countries in our sample. We argue that understanding country-level variability in accounting discretion is crucial to understand overall managerial discretion at the firm-level. We contribute to the literature by providing an objective measure of accounting discretion across different countries.\nCo-authored with Marcio Pimenta (PhD Candidate).\nThe first article of this project was accepted for presentation at the 6th annual International Corporate Governance Society (ICGS) conference to be held November 14 - 16, 2020.\nYou can check the slides here."

    "title": "Cross-National Governance Research - A Systematic Review and Assessment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Research Question/Issue:\nUsing a systematic literature review approach, we survey 192 cross-national comparative studies published in 23 scholarly journals in the fields of accounting, economics, finance, and management for the period 2003 to 2014. The purpose is to synthesize and appraise the extant empirical research on the interplay between country- and firm-level governance mechanisms and the effects on firm outcomes. Particular focus is placed on studies that examine firm economic performance.\n\n\nResearch Findings/Results:\nWe identify and distinguish between two groups of cross-national governance studies. The first type compares macro, country-level outcomes and the second compares three different firm-level outcomes: economic performance, governance mechanisms, and strategic decisions. We compare the theoretical frameworks used and further analyze the country-level factors and firm-level governance attributes that have been combined to investigate their interplay and the effects on firm outcomes. We find substantial variation in the use and measurement of country-level factors as well as a variety of causal forms used to explain the combined effects of country- and firm-level governance mechanisms. This wide variability precludes comparison, and consequently prevents identifying consistent patterns of influence between country-level governance factors and firm-level governance mechanisms and/or performance. We identify research gaps and provide fruitful directions for future research on this topic.\n\n\nTheoretical Implications:\nThe cross-national governance research has been guided mainly by an economic perspective focusing on international differences in the effectiveness of specific governance mechanisms. Few comparative studies have integrated an institutional perspective or examined the external forces that drive the diffusion and use of specific governance mechanisms. Such integrative framework would improve the understanding of cross-national differences in the salient dimensions of country-level governance factors and how they mediate the effectiveness of firm-level governance mechanisms.\n\n\nPractitioner Implications:\nOur results reveal that firm- and country-level governance mechanisms have been interacted and combined, either to address various agency problems or to compensate for a weak national environment. This calls for regulators and investors to consider national governance factors when assessing firm-level governance practices.\nCo-authored with Eduardo Schiehll."

    "title": "Country-level governance quality, ownership concentration, and debt maturity - A comparative study of Brazil and Chile",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Research Question/Issue:\nThis study investigates the interplay between country-level governance quality and the capital structure choice at the firm level in Brazil and Chile. We examine the association between a firm’s ownership concentration and its debt maturity structure and whether country-level governance quality influences this association.\n\n\nResearch Findings/Results:\nUsing a large firm-level dataset from Brazil and Chile for the period 2008-2013, we find a positive association between low ownership concentration and debt maturity. However, this association becomes negative when the largest shareholder has high ownership concentration. This result suggests that long-term debt and ownership concentration act as substitute monitoring mechanisms. Moreover, debt maturity is inversely related to our aggregated index of country-level governance quality, suggesting that in countries with governance systems that effectively protect debt holders, firms with high benefits of control (high ownership concentration) will use debt with shorter repayment periods in order to benefit from frequent monitoring by debt holders. Overall, our results support the view that financial markets tend to pressure firms with high benefits of control or greater agency conflict to make a tradeoff between the benefits of control and the cost and maturity structure of debt financing.\n\n\nTheoretical Implications:\nThis study contributes to the research on comparative corporate governance and capital structure. We also respond to recent calls to bridge the gap between under- and over-socialized views of corporate governance by examining the interplay between firm- and country-level governance variables. Our findings suggest a substitution effect between monitoring by equity holders and by debt holders, and that country-level governance quality exerts a disciplinary influence over a firm’s choice of debt maturity structure.\n\n\nPractitioner Implications:\nInvestors seeking to enter emerging markets such as Brazil and Chile can benefit from considering national governance factors that enhance debt holders’ external monitoring effectiveness. Because our findings show the importance of considering and improving the quality of country-level governance, they are also useful for policy makers aiming to reform corporate governance practices in emerging markets.\nCo-authored with Eduardo Schiehll and Paulo Terra."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nWe investigate whether investor protection (i.e. shareholder protection and creditor rights) is associated with how entrenched managers set corporate cash holdings. Our sample covers more than 6,000 firms from 29 countries (roughly 16,000 observations during 2010-2013). We find that the entrenchment-cash holdings association is sensitive to the level of shareholder protection but not to the level of creditor rights. Moreover, we find that the way shareholder protection shapes this association depends upon how managers become entrenched. When managers become entrenched through ownership, shareholders consent to their preferences to hold more cash, whereas, when managers become entrenched through CEO duality, shareholders force them to disgorge cash. We interpret our findings as evidence that shareholders agree to increase cash when managers are aligned with them by ownership but prefer to decrease cash when they are not aligned, whereas creditors do not influence entrenched managers’ cash holdings decisions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nThis study examines the effects of the firm’s ownership concentration and its institutional environment on corporate debt maturity choices. As ownership concentration and debt maturity are alternative governance mechanisms, we theorize and investigate whether their association is influenced by country-level governance factors that enhance outside monitoring by minority shareholders and debtholders. Our investigation is based on a dataset of 50,599 firm-year observations from 38 countries. We use a propensity-score matching approach and find that the effect of ownership concentration on debt maturity is conditional to country-level governance attributes. Ownership concentration has a negative effect on debt maturity in countries where both shareholder protection and creditor rights are weak. Ownership concentration, however, tends to lengthen debt maturity as protection increases, and this positive effect on the length of debt maturity is stronger in countries enhancing protection towards debtholders (instead of shareholders). We also explore other characteristics of ownership structure, such as the identity and presence of controlling shareholders. These results corroborate the view that entrenched shareholders may use debt maturity opportunistically. Our study provides new insights into the interplay between firm- and country-level governance mechanisms and a deeper understanding of cross-country differences in the association between ownership structure and debt financing.\nCo-authored with Eduardo Schiehll and Paulo Terra."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We examine the role of country-level legal investor protection (i.e., shareholder and creditor protection) on firm investment–cash flow sensitivity. Using underexplored research data on investor protection across 21 countries and working with a conservative empirical design, we extend prior literature on the relation between investor protection and investment–cash flow sensitivity and provide new evidence on how these country-level attributes interact to explain a firm’s investment–cash flow sensitivity. We find that either the strong legal protection of minority shareholders or the strong legal protection of creditors reduces the sensitivity of investment to internal cash flow. However, in countries with strong levels of both minority shareholder and creditor protection, investment–cash flow sensitivity increases. Our results remain robust after controlling for several alternative explanations. The results support the argument that overregulation arises when policymakers increase investor protection at levels that lead firms to avoid external sources of finance, hampering firm investment. Our findings suggest that countries face a regulatory trade-off such that increasing investor protection (either shareholder or creditors protection) enhances financial markets efficiency, but excessive regulation can indeed lead to financial markets inefficiencies.\nCo-authored with Luiz Ricardo Kabbach de Castro, Eduardo Schiehll and Paulo Terra."

    "title": "Does control concentration affect board busyness? International evidence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nPrevious literature suggests that shareholders can concentrate control without cash flow rights, creating incentives to expropriate firm resources. However, previous research does not help identify the board structure of firms whose controlling shareholder has an inflated control concentration. We investigate whether and how firm control concentration affects the structure of the board of directors. Building upon the literature on busy boards, we investigate specific characteristics of the board of directors: the number of directors’ directorships and the number of committee positions. We study an initial sample of 8688 firms from 41 countries. After using propensity score matching to mitigate selection bias, we keep 3570 firms. We find that controlling shareholders with higher control concentration select board members with more directorships and fewer committee positions. We interpret this result as evidence supporting the signaling incentive hypothesis, which suggests that controlling shareholders prefer a more shareholder-friendly board structure, possibly to signal the market that they pursue decisions that maximize firm value. The results are robust to several alternative specifications and methods. Our study helps fill gaps in the literature on busy boards by showing the consequences of the incentives of shareholders with concentrated control on how firms allocate the time of their busy directors. Our study also sheds light on the theoretical aspects that affect the preferences of those shareholders who can most harm minority shareholders. Finally, our study has practical implications that could help regulatory institutions make recommendations for the compositions of boards of directors and/or committees.\nCo-authored with Cristiano Machado Costa."

Collecting data from Brazilian (treatment group) and Argentinian, Chilean, Colombian, Mexican, and Peruvian firms (control group) and using a difference-in-difference technique, we show that Brazilian firms with concentrated ownership structure decreased risk taking after the reform. Our results suggest that these firms reduced risk in response to increasing creditors’ protection, possibly because controlling shareholder fear losing control.

However, traditional corporate governance mechanisms designed to curb agency problems may undermine firm growth because they are mostly backward-looking and inherently problematic when facing uncertainty. In fact, they may restrain or disincentivize managerial creativeness and alertness, which can be instrumental to maximize firm value. Our goal is to advance a conceptual framework that integrates into corporate governance elements literature factors that are key for creativity but which have been overlooked in corporate governance. Drawing on a combination of creativity and entrepreneurship literatures, we discuss two parameters—unlikelihood and opacity—which serve as the basis to propose four different types of entrepreneurial projects. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the optimal corporate governance configurations for each project types. Our framework can inform the design of better tailored governance mechanisms that are specific to a firm’s environment and its projects.\nArticle co-authored with Michael Araki."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nThis study uses a multidisciplinary lens to investigate new determinants of the puzzling phenomenon of zero leverage, where firms contain only equity in their capital structure. We draw on insights from entrepreneurship and creativity theories, alongside traditional corporate governance (CG) literature, to reframe the construct of risk-taking and develop the novel construct of rule-taking, which entails compliance with powerful outside parties and current best practices of CG. We hypothesize that risk-taking is associated with a wider wedge of information and costs regarding internal and external financing, leading to a greater likelihood of debt eschewing. Conversely, rule-taking is hypothesized to reduce the range of acceptable choices in the firm, which makes the adoption of the “aberrant” behavior of zero-leverage less likely. Using 9222 firm-observations from 37 countries, the results corroborate our hypotheses, showing a positive (negative) association between risk-taking (rule-taking) and zero leverage. The results are robust to several alternative specifications and matching samples. Our study offers insights to policymakers and investors to clarify the antecedents of zero-leverage behavior as a strategy to deal with the information gap between insiders and outsiders. Our perspective underscores the existence of an inherent communication penalty between an insider and an outsider when the former is performing actions that are non-typical under the oversight of the latter. Thus, by deepening understanding on risk-taking and rule-taking, we provide a more nuanced view of how firms can optimize capital and CG structures, with special implications for the adoption of well-tailored bundles of CG mechanisms under different circumstances.\nArticle co-authored with Michael Araki."
