    "title": "How to create an effective master’s presentation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post aims to help students who are about to present the master’s dissertation to the committee. I hope it is helpful to you!\nIf you are presenting a Ph.D. thesis, the depth of each slide changes a bit (and the time you have also increases by some minutes, to 20-25 minutes), but the order and structure are the same.\nFirst, ask your supervisor how long is the meeting expected to last. Usually, it is about 1h, but it can vary from school to school.\nThen, ask how long you have to present. Usually, master students have about 15 to 20 minutes. When you find that out, assume this is your most important rule to follow. You have to stick with the expected time.\nAssuming you have 15 minutes, you should not create more than 7 to 8 slides (9 to 10 in total, see below). Assume 2 min per slide. Professors won’t pay attention to presentations with 20, 30 slides.\nRemember that professors in your committee are experts in the topic of your dissertation. So don’t bother them with unnecessary explanations. You have to show that you know what you are talking about and you are all over your work, but remember that you are the rookie in the room. So stick to the time that is allocated to you.\nIf you have 8 slides, you should use the first 2 to a) give the context of your work, b) motivate your research, c) justify why it is important, d) discuss the research question. This order can vary throughout the slides, but it is almost mandatory to present these four topics. You can use chapter 1 of your dissertation to create these slides.\nThen, slide #3 should contain the theory that you used in your work. Avoid long paragraphs (nobody will have the time to read them while listening to you) and prefer to cite articles using bullets. You must be prepared to discuss each of the articles you mention in this slide (and all articles you cite in the dissertation, for that matter). You can include one or two short sentences to aggregate somehow the articles you cite, but do not include full paragraphs in your slides to discuss a specific article (you can use the appendix for that, see below).\nYou use slides #4 and #5 to discuss your empirical design. Again, avoid entire paragraphs and discuss using bullets, equations, and perhaps figures. Also, discuss the sample, any instrumental variable, any adjustment you made, etc. Be prepared to talk for around 3 to 4 minutes about these 2 slides since professors will pay a lot of attention to this part of your presentation. This might be the most critical part of your talk.\nYou have 2 slides to present the results. Avoid tables, but you can use part of them with extreme caution. If you want to include something from a table, include only the part that matters (and draw professors’ attention to the pages of your dissertation where the table is). It is always a good idea to come out with a figure to present the results if you can have one.\nFinally, use the final slides for your concluding remarks. Again, avoid entire paragraphs, and prefer using bullets.\nThere you go! 8 slides to a 15-min presentation!\nThis is how I see a nice master presentation, but these are not rules. If you feel you need 1 or 2 more slides, you can have it. However, do not use more time than expected!\nIn total, you may have 10 slides because you can use the first slide to include the title of your dissertation and your name, and the latter to include the same information again with a “Thank you for your attention” message. You do not spend time with these slides; they are there only to “initiate” and “conclude” your presentation, respectively. They are usually the slides that you keep on the screen while the real discussion is happening.\n\nAppendix\nIf you feel necessary, you can include additional information (perhaps an entire paragraph or a table) that you did not have in the first 8 slides of content. Include any information you want after the “Thank you for your attention” slide. You will not use these slides in the original 15 minutes you have. You will only use them if professors ask something you do not have in the first 8 slides.\nThese are the slides to make you comfortable that you will not forget anything about your work and have the means to explain parts that you did not have time to explain in the original 15 minutes. The appendix is like your insurance to make sure you can answer all their questions.\n\n\nAdditional comments\n\nCome prepared to discuss all parts of your work. Professors will probably ask for clarifications about specific details that she or he did not understand. More specifically, after you use your 15 minutes, your supervisor will provide time to each member of the committee to ask you questions, make comments and say anything they want to say. Usually, each professor uses about 15 minutes, but your supervisor will not cut their time if they need more.\nThis experience is one of those moments in time when you learn a lot about your own work and academia in general. So take notes of all comments that professors make to you. Prefer taking notes by hand, since handwriting increases learning, boosts memory, and is more friendly than typing.\nAlmost always, professors see issues in your main text and make recommendations for dealing with these issues. Your notes will help you later to make such corrections. Your supervisor is not obliged to take notes for you.\nAlmost always, you will have to provide a second version of your dissertation correcting the issues professors see. So, if you do not take notes, you will have trouble making such corrections.\nAfter all professors state their comments, your supervisor will invite them to a closed room to decide the result of your presentation. They usually take 15 minutes to discuss your work to reach a conclusion. These days, when most presentations occur via Zoom, most likely, your supervisor and all professors go to a breakout room, while all other participants stay in the main room.\nWhen professors are done discussing, they come back to the main room to announce the result. The outcomes vary from school to school but are mainly one of these three: 1) you are not approved and receive 60 to 90 days to make all corrections asked and present your work again to the committee; 2) you are approved, but you have to provide a second version of your work with all corrections made, 3) you are approved without modifications asked. The most common outcome is #2, but it can be #1 or #3.\n\nThat is it! Good luck with your presentation!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s see how to create a graph of the levels of Democracy in Brazil. The data come from the V-Dem project, which is amazing.\nFirst, download the data.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(downloader)\nurl <- \"https://v-dem.net/media/datasets/Country_Year_V-Dem_Core_R_v12.zip\"\ndownload(url, dest=\"dataset.zip\", mode=\"wb\") \nunzip (\"dataset.zip\", exdir = \"./\")\ndata <- readRDS(\"Country_Year_V-Dem_Core_R_v12/V-Dem-CY-Core-v12.rds\")\nfile.remove(\"dataset.zip\")\nfile.remove(\"Country_Year_V-Dem_Core_R_v12/V-Dem-CY-Core-v12.rds\")\n\nFor convenience, let’s focus only on the years after 2000 and in some selected countries.\n\nnames(data)[names(data) == 'country_text_id'] <- 'Country'\ndata <-subset(data, year >= 2000)\ncountries <- as.data.frame(c(\"Brazil\", \"France\", \"Germany\", \"United States of America\", \"United Kingdom\", \"Italy\", \"Japan\", \"China\", \"India\")) \ncolnames(countries) <- \"country_name\"                  \ndata <- merge(data, countries , by=\"country_name\")\n\nNow let’s have fun visualizing data. More about the clarifications in : https://www.v-dem.net/static/website/img/refs/codebookv12.pdf\n\n\nElectoral democracy index (D) (v2x_polyarchy)\nClarification: The electoral principle of democracy seeks to embody the core value of making rulers responsive to citizens, achieved through electoral competition for the electorate’s approval under circumstances when suffrage is extensive; political and civil society organizations can operate freely; elections are clean and not marred by fraud or systematic irregularities; and elections affect the composition of the chief executive of the country. In between elections, there is freedom of expression and an independent media capable of presenting alternative views on matters of political relevance. In the V-Dem conceptual scheme, electoral democracy is understood as an essential element of any other conception of representative democracy —liberal, participatory, deliberative, egalitarian, or some other.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_polyarchy) ) +   geom_line(aes(colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Electoral democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Electoral democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal democracy index (D) (v2x_libdem)\nClarification: The liberal principle of democracy emphasizes the importance of protecting individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority. The liberal model takes a “negative” view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government. This is achieved by constitutionally protected civil liberties, strong rule of law, an independent judiciary, and effective checks and balances that, together, limit the exercise of executive power. To make this a measure of liberal democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_libdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Liberal democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Liberal democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipatory democracy index (D) (v2x_partipdem)\nClarification: The participatory principle of democracy emphasizes active participation by citizens in all political processes, electoral and non-electoral. It is motivated by uneasiness about a bedrock practice of electoral democracy: delegating authority to representatives. Thus, direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. This model of democracy thus takes suffrage for granted, emphasizing engagement in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational elected bodies. To make it a measure of participatory democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_partipdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Participatory democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Participatory democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliberative democracy index (D) (v2x_delibdem)\nClarification: The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions—as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levels—from preference formation to final decision—among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. To make it a measure of not only the deliberative principle but also of democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_delibdem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Deliberative democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Deliberative democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgalitarian democracy index (D) (v2x_egaldem)\nClarification: The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate. Egalitarian democracy is achieved when 1 rights and freedoms of individuals are protected equally across all social groups; and 2 resources are distributed equally across all social groups; 3 groups and individuals enjoy equal access to power. To make it a measure of egalitarian democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = year, y=v2x_egaldem) ) +   geom_line(aes(group = Country, colour = Country)) +  \n  labs(y='Egalitarian democracy index', \n       x='Year', \n       title = \"Egalitarian democracy index (selected countries since 2000)\",\n       caption = \"Source: https://www.v-dem.net/\") + theme_solarized()+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = data[which(data$year == 2021),], aes(label = country_name) , size = 2.5 ,  max.overlaps = Inf)\n\n\n\n\nThanks for passing by!"
