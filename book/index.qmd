# Introduction

This is a collection of selected notes that I am continually updating using **Quarto**.

The primary purpose is to make available online stuff that is important to my  **classes**.

You may see a bunch of other stuff in [henriquemartins.net/](https://henriquemartins.net/)

Also, please check: [opencodecom.net](https://opencodecom.net/). You'll enjoy it! 

**If you find typos, please let me know.**

I hope you find it **useful**. Thanks for passing by!
