I hold a Ph.D. in Finance, and I am currently an Assistant Professor at [FGV/EAESP](https://eaesp.fgv.br/) (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). 

I teach corporate finance, corporate governance and financial analysis at the undergraduate, MBA, Master, and Ph.D. levels. I am currently working on several projects on these topics. 

If you have any questions about my research, or if you want to work with me, contact me at [henrique.martins@fgv.br](henrique.martins@fgv.br).
